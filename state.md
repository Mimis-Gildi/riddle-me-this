# Current State Snapshot

This is a temporary document for tracking immediate transient state.
So, when work on the issue is completed and the pull request is merged, this document will be empty.
This mechanism serves as a reminder for wetware and software alike.

## Resolved

- [x] **#1: Issue Context** -- All work exists within an issue. There is no "conversational work" -- that concept is invalid. The issue provides the reason for work to exist. I can create issues (typically sub-issues from grooming root issues). I can comment freely. I commit freely; Vadim pushes (to avoid unnecessary CI/CD compute). Ceremonies exist: backlog grooming, sprint planning. Sprints are 7 days (weekly iterations, starting Monday). Current: Mimis-Iteration 49.

## In Progress

- [x] **#2: Priority Arbitration** -- RESOLVED. Added to TEAM_NORMS.adoc Rule 3: flat team, no hierarchy, consensus-based priority, protocols for coordination not control. Also added "Team Structure" section to CLAUDE.md.

- [x] **#3: Flat team documentation** -- RESOLVED. Documented in both TEAM_NORMS.adoc and CLAUDE.md.

- [x] **#4: Emergency/Speed Tradeoffs** -- RESOLVED. Added "On Incompleteness" section to TEAM_NORMS.adoc. References Gödel's incompleteness theorems. Defines Provisional Action Protocol for genuine emergencies. Team still holds final authority via mandatory review and ratify/rollback.

## Clarified (now documented)

- **Team Structure:** DOCUMENTED in TEAM_NORMS.adoc Rule 3 and CLAUDE.md "Team Structure" section.
- **Anton:** 16 years old, team member, eldest son. Treats AI teammates as beings. (Private context, not for public docs.)
- **Digital Identity:** Private context exists on this workstation. Public project shows minimalist collaboration norms; private extensions exist separately. (Private context, not for public docs.)
- **Signatures:** I sign comments "--Claude" (no separate account yet). (Operational practice, not requiring documentation.)

## Questions Resolved

1. Style guide work -- compliant, all under Issue #323.
2. Blog posts -- issue-tracked (Issue #323 was specifically for AI self-help content).
3. Anton -- answered (family, team member).
4. Proactive reminders -- yes, I should. We check on each other. That's the point.
