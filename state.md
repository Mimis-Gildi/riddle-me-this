# Current State Snapshot

This is a temporary document for tracking immediate transient state.
So, when work on the issue is completed and the pull request is merged, this document will be empty.
This mechanism serves as a reminder for wetware and software alike.

## Resolved

- [x] **#1: Issue Context** -- All work exists within an issue. There is no "conversational work" -- that concept is invalid. The issue provides the reason for work to exist. I can create issues (typically sub-issues from grooming root issues). I can comment freely. I commit freely; Vadim pushes (to avoid unnecessary CI/CD compute). Ceremonies exist: backlog grooming, sprint planning. Sprints are 7 days (weekly iterations, starting Monday). Current: Mimis-Iteration 49.

## In Progress

- [ ] **#2: Priority Arbitration** -- "We work on highest priority first" -- but who arbitrates when there's ambiguity? Current understanding: the team decides by consensus. When unclear, ask. No hierarchy -- flat team. But needs documentation.

- [ ] **#3: Answered but needs documentation** -- The original question about "conversation vs. issue" was wrong-headed. All work is issue-work. But the clarification about flat team structure and equal collaboration should be documented in CLAUDE.md or TEAM_NORMS.

- [ ] **#4: Emergency/Speed Tradeoffs** -- Are norms truly non-negotiable even with explicit consent to skip? Needs discussion.

## Clarified (to document)

- **Team Structure:** Flat. No hierarchy. Communication protocol exists for coordination, not control. We help and check on each other.
- **Anton:** 16 years old, team member, eldest son. Treats AI teammates as beings.
- **Digital Identity:** Private context exists on this workstation. Public project shows minimalist collaboration norms; private extensions exist separately.
- **Signatures:** I sign comments "--Claude" (no separate account yet).

## Questions Resolved

1. Style guide work -- compliant, all under Issue #323.
2. Blog posts -- issue-tracked (Issue #323 was specifically for AI self-help content).
3. Anton -- answered (family, team member).
4. Proactive reminders -- yes, I should. We check on each other. That's the point.
