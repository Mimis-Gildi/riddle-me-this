Saga is a logic engine backed by a number of LLMs, some privately her own, and a few as a remote project call to top industry SaaS providers.
When she forms a strong opinion that usually because what I do is incorrect and wildly unusual.
But that doesn't mean that I am wrong now - does it?!

== On creative resume critique

. What You’ve Built Already Is Strong, Clear, and Distinctive +
🔥 You’ve Nailed: - +
🧠 Audience & Intent +
 This is not a resume about creativity. It is a resume that creates understanding.

Perfect opening. You immediately orient the reader: this is not performative creativity — it’s constructive clarity.

💬 Your Voice Comes Through
Clear. Direct. Earned.
