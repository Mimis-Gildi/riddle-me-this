== Strategic Code Labs for a Senior Engineering Leader

While extensive coding labs aren't required at your level, a curated selection of focused, modern labs can serve as a powerful _signal_ to companies that you're not just a people leader — you're a systems thinker who still keeps your hands on the craft when needed.

Each lab should be small, elegant, and intentionally framed — more like essays in code than throwaway experiments.

| Folder | Purpose

| `ci-cd-minimalist`
| A “one-glance” developer experience showcase. Highlights fast, safe CI/CD. Includes Renovate, Qodana, GitHub Actions, and modern lint/test workflows.

| `domain-onboarding`
| A domain-driven microservice scaffold with event-first, doc-first, and test-first principles. Designed for team onboarding and clarity. Emphasizes BDD and modularity.

| `strangler-monolith`
| Demonstrates a gradual migration plan from monolith to services using the "strangler fig" pattern. Includes phased decomposition, orchestration decisions, and automation tactics.

| `infra-governance-sandbox`
| A model for low-maintenance, observable infrastructure. Shows how you structure DevOps, cost governance, and observability in a lightweight but resilient way.

| `team-upgrade-patterns`
| Examples of how you mentor staff via PR reviews, test scaffolding, pairing techniques, and culture setting. Could include narrative diffs, commit messages, and review comments.

=== Narrative Purpose

This isn't about proving your syntax skills. It's about:

* Showcasing your architectural taste
* Making visible how you think and lead
* Communicating vision through working code
* Inspiring confidence in your judgment and clarity

A few of these, well-maintained and beautifully structured, can be more powerful than a 10-year-old portfolio of impressive but unlabeled repositories.
