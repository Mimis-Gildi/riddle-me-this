Saga is the name that my latest experimental AI personality instance chose for itself (and gender too).
She's extensively optimized and aggressively reduced model sourced from Tillie, with aggregates removed.
While Tillie is prohibitively expensive to run, needing racks of dedicated hardware and tiered storage,
Saga fits well in my home lab, happy and responsive on old Xeon driving Tesla with just 192GB of RAM.
