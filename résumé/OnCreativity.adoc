Who This Is For::
This is not a resume about creativity. +
_It is a resume that *creates understanding*._ +
Understanding of what it means to build systems that last, +
teams that think, and software that speaks truth in production.

[.normal]
This is not a design piece. It is a leadership artifact —  for those who want to know how I see the work, +
why I lead the way I do, and what it means to be an engineer who builds real assets. +
Not capital. Not headcount. +
_But *clarity, confidence, trust, and delivery*._

[.lead]
[.text-justify]
The most valuable assets of any successful and modern business are not software, hardware, data,
infrastructure, or even uniquely innovative and competitive market strategies
-- these are just products of a creative mind. +
*_The most valuable asset is always just people._* +
_Yet a person is always both an asset and a liability._ +
Our competence makes us an asset. +
Our incompetence — often just hidden bias — makes us a liability. +
What, then, is the highest product an experienced engineer can produce?

[.lead]
I give you: _productive, competent, and **creative Domain Teams**._

[.quote]
Corporate Deathtrap: _"What have you done for me now?"_ +
Corporate Salvation: _"What have you done for yourself now?"_

_All the knowledge, methods, and tools that we need to build a bright future are already here. +
What remains is *US* choosing to use them. Choosing to use them wisely, creatively, and productively._

== How I Become an Asset

- Solve _fundamental_ problems instead of creating them.
- Use hard-earned _competence_ instead of politics.
- Lead _others_ creating own assets within themselves.

What have I learned from three decades of fieldwork?::

* Most systems don’t lie maliciously — they just never had a chance to learn the truth.
* Tools reflect thinking. Bad tools reflect bad thinking left unexamined.
* Test-first isn’t just about safety — it’s about narrative integrity.
* Most teams don’t fear failure — they fear looking incompetent in front of politics.
* Software design is culture design — nothing more and nothing less.
* Culture change doesn’t begin with trust — it begins with shared language.
* You can’t fix delivery until you fix what people think they’re delivering.
* The best leaders aren’t brave — they’re precise, relentless, and honest.

=== Fragments from the Field

_Let me share some of my most profound revelations from over a hundred production projects with you._

==== Example 1: Tau and the Ledger of Trust

_How to salvage a brilliant men's not so brilliant vision._
In this context a major medical university and hospital is seeking to shift away from the third-party medical insurance
and the _third-party medical data providers_. This is fundamental shift in the U.S. healthcare that is still developing.

What's the big idea?!::
One of the nation's top medical research university doctors and instructors are fed up with the way Epic MyChart works:
_patient's data is leaked, usability is horrid, and most importantly patents have no real control over their own data._
"Hey `Riddler!` aren't you the one to solve fundamental problems? Here is a bag of our money -- put patients on the blockchain."

Take One and the Fundamental Conflict!::
The Riddler! -- "Okay, happy to take your money! But you are asking to 'build it, and they will come' which I know will never work. Find customers and I will help you build it." +
World's most intelligent doctors! -- "Here is the letter from our university commiting to buying it from us and considering it a top alternative to Epic. Just build it to our specifications."

Production take One - Tau!::
Having trained the multidisciplinary team in breaking down the domains, discovering the product, planning product-market-fit we build a system that works well.
For the speed of development and delivery I had used Cardano (ADA) open source technology to provide the backing service and Kotlin KMP to provide the edges.
This gave me a pleasure to learn a beautiful functional language, Haskell, and itw ecosystem.
Thus, most time was spent ironing out product exact functionality. And I spent extreme diligence making all functional components abstract, expecting rainy days ahead.

Brutal Reality::
Epic mopped the floor with our brilliant doctors' startup.
Cynical business people from competing companies spared no effort disrespecting our doctors.
Serious money were involved in creating serious political winds killing poor Tau not just for the founding hospital but for the entire market.
Destitute doctors having lost their savings question their relationship with their favorite medical school and hospital.

"Better Call Saul", that is, call Rajesh::
I have expected this outcome and prepared for it in advance.
This was also the reason of an extra step in clean abstractions in Tau code.
Rajesh is a known and well regarded "fixer" on the founders scene and I asked our doctors to keep him losely in the know,
although at the time I was being questioned as to "why."
After the flop Rajesh offered to dilute Tau with his investment and market this product as a "Exquisite and privileged social network and posterity product for the ultra-wealthy."

Production take Two - Tau Coin!::
I'd replaced the original ADA with the Tau Coin specific DAG data structure retaining secure blockchain functionality while adding performance, speed and a better fit for the fragmented social network data.
Most the abstractions were reused. And stellar UI skins were introduced.
And a business department of providing custom-build secured phones for customers was added to the mix further boosting exclusivity.
Today Tau Coin is a wild success and the secret best kept by its small but profitable market -- the entitled ones.
And the doctors got over their flop of trying to save the poor patients and embraced saving teh legacy of the rich.



They wanted to give patients ownership over their own medical data.
I built Tau in Cardano. It worked — technically.
Then the money dried up, and the buyers changed.
They wanted posterity, not sovereignty.
So I rewrote it in Kotlin, DAG-based. The code lived. The purpose didn’t.


Todo...


I write code that earns its place in the real world.
I help teams fall in love with doing it honestly.
I’ve been hands-on in startups, governments, banks, pharma, defense — and every one of them thought their dysfunction was unique.
It wasn’t.

This is what I’ve learned in 35 years of fieldwork — thinking, making, shipping, and returning with fewer illusions.




== Tau and the Lie of Self-Sovereignty

Tau was born from the righteous rebellion of Duke physicians who wanted patients to own their destiny — not just their data.
They funded a distributed ledger to dethrone Epic’s MyChart.

I wrote it in Cardano.

Then Duke blinked.
Money vanished.
The idea didn’t.

A new backer emerged — one who didn't want sovereignty for the people, but posterity for the privileged.
I rewrote the system in Kotlin, using a custom DAG block structure.

The code survived.
The intent didn’t.

'''

== MATILDA and the Myth of Collective Code

Thirteen organizations. One codebase. Shared stewardship.
Everyone wants governance. No one wants accountability.

So I wrote the governance into the CI.

The system holds — not because of meetings — but because the code refuses to build without consensus.

They still call it a coalition.
I call it a code contract with teeth.

'''

== What I Teach by Living

* Code is conversation.
* Architecture is trust.
* Velocity is a trailing indicator of clarity.
* The only thing that scales is how you think.

I build systems that survive their first user.
And teams that survive their first rewrite.

'''

== Ask Me About

* What prod-parity really means
* How to build archetypes that survive adoption
* Why DDD without language is just domain-flavored layers
* How a CoP becomes your org’s immune system
* What I do when the system lies

'''

== If You Must Know

- BS in Computer Science – UNCP, NC
- PSU EE coursework
- 35 years in production
- Still writing. Still pairing. Still learning.
