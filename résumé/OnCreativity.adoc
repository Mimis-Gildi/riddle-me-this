Who This Is For::
This is not a resume about creativity. +
_It is a resume that *creates understanding*._ +
Understanding of what it means to build systems that last, +
teams that think, and software that speaks truth in production.

[.normal]
This is not a design piece. It is a leadership artifact —  for those who want to know how I see the work, +
why I lead the way I do, and what it means to be an engineer who builds real assets. +
Not capital. Not headcount. +
_But *clarity, confidence, trust, and delivery*._

[.lead]
[.text-justify]
The most valuable assets of any successful and modern business are not software, hardware, data,
infrastructure, or even uniquely innovative and competitive market strategies
-- these are just products of a creative mind. +
*_The most valuable asset is always just people._* +
_Yet a person is always both an asset and a liability._ +
Our competence makes us an asset. +
Our incompetence — often just hidden bias — makes us a liability. +
What, then, is the highest product an experienced engineer can produce?

[.lead]
I give you: _productive, competent, and **creative Domain Teams**._

[.quote]
Corporate Deathtrap: _"What have you done for me now?"_ +
Corporate Salvation: _"What have you done for yourself now?"_

_All the knowledge, methods, and tools that we need to build a bright future are already here. +
What remains is *US* choosing to use them. Choosing to use them wisely, creatively, and productively._

== How I Become an Asset

- Solve _fundamental_ problems instead of creating them.
- Use hard-earned _competence_ instead of politics.
- Lead _others_ creating own assets within themselves.

What have I learned from three decades of fieldwork?::

* Most systems don’t lie maliciously — they just never had a chance to learn the truth.
* Tools reflect thinking. Bad tools reflect bad thinking left unexamined.
* Test-first isn’t just about safety — it’s about narrative integrity.
* Most teams don’t fear failure — they fear looking incompetent in front of politics.
* Software design is culture design — nothing more and nothing less.
* Culture change doesn’t begin with trust — it begins with shared language.
* You can’t fix delivery until you fix what people think they’re delivering.
* The best leaders aren’t brave — they’re precise, relentless, and honest.

.Tau and the Ledger of Trust
====

*Context:*
A major medical university approached us to build a secure system that would return control of health records to patients
— bypassing Epic, and eventually, third-party insurance.

*Setup:*
The doctors’ vision was idealistic and righteous: _privacy, transparency, sovereignty_.
They brought funding, letters of commitment, and the belief that if we built it, trust would follow.
I believed in the mission — and insisted on its integrity.

*Runway Zero:*
We built Tau: a secure, Kotlin-based edge system on top of Cardano (ADA).
Functional, elegant, and abstracted for survival from the first commit.
At its core: a blockchain-backed, one-time authorization token, implemented as a smart contract.
It let patients define who could access their data, when, how often, and for what purpose.
My team in Prague multiplied our velocity. We shipped.
I held the line on ethics as tightly as on architecture.

*Reality:*
Idealism doesn’t sell. The market pushed back.
Epic controlled the optics. The doctors lost their savings.
The hospital withdrew. The system was never breached, but it was never adopted.
And no one called it a failure — but no one touched it again.

*Repurposing:*
To protect the doctors' investment, I engaged a longtime collaborator — a founder-whisperer.
He reframed Tau as a legacy vault for the ultra-wealthy.
No code changed hands. Only the mission did.
I replaced the Haskell-based Cardano backend with a custom DAG written in Kotlin.
The architecture held. The value proposition shifted — dramatically.

*Disappointment:*
I had hoped Tau might return — reborn for everyone.
Freemium models and scaled subscriptions have democratized much harder ideas.
But when offered profit and exclusivity, the doctors declined to open the vault.
Posterity, it turns out, is not a universal right — only a luxury offering.

*Legacy:*
Tau lives on — lavishly. Not for patients.
For the preservation of privilege.
The product is stunning. The code is clean.
The conscience is, still, conflicted.

.MATILDA and the Governance That Builds Itself
====

*Context:*
MATILDA began as a DoD research initiative nearly 25 years ago.
Its original purpose was to serve as a self-managing expert system for navigating TOGAF/DOGAF processes.
What made it unique was the fusion of automated governance — DevOps, MLOps, DataOps — with content analytics and policy enforcement in one.

Years later, parts of that framework became essential to SEER — a sentiment-analysis startup in the ad-tech space.
It soon became difficult to tell which components belonged to whom.
Disputes over scope and ownership led to a “Coalition License,” now shared across 13 academic and commercial entities.
ASE Inc. maintains the core framework — because the original RTFM system is still seen as MATILDA’s parent.

*Problem:*
Everyone wanted control. No one wanted accountability.
Meetings stalled. Governance frayed. Forks loomed.
The license made the arrangement legal.
But the architecture had to make it livable.

*Solution:*
Instead of enforcing governance through people, I wrote it into the pipelines.
Builds fail when contracts are violated, when boundaries are crossed, or when proposals lack quorum.
CI became the constitution. Pipelines became law.

*Result:*
No one asks who owns what.
The system enforces its own order.
People argue in docs, not in commits.
Releases are boring — and reliable.

*Legacy:*
MATILDA still runs. Quietly.
Stable. Versioned. Politically neutral.
Everyone talks about its offspring — the clever, narrow AI personalities.
No one talks about MATILDA itself.
Except, perhaps, yours truly. +
Which is how I know it works.

.GEICO and the Speed of Vapor
====

*Context:*
At GEICO, I led the engineering of a distributed system built on Kotlin, React, Azure, and Kubernetes.
It was the first in the org to follow trunk-based development, true prod-parity, and test-first delivery.

*Conflict:*
To ship cleanly, I had to rewrite the inherited DevOps pipelines — basic scaffolds that ignored security, violated contracts, and leaked PII.
I refused to publish artifacts that didn’t meet _any_ meaningful production standard.

Leadership didn’t see integrity. They saw delay.
To them, shipping faster reduced _personal_ reputational risk.
What got released — or what it broke — mattered less than when it shipped.

The irony? The “DevOps transformation” had already been reported as complete.
No one was allowed to admit that it wasn’t even started yet.

*Decision:*
I stayed the course.
The components I built were held up as standards — so I used them to create archetypes for many other domains.
We shipped in two variants: Kotlin and Java with Spring Boot, both with full documentation and production patterns.
Workups diverged among domains, but the seed is planted.

*Result:*
The system shipped.
It included defensive layers that absorbed misconfigurations from legacy Ops while remaining compliant with CNCF best practices.
The hardest part wasn’t design — it was protecting good systems from inherited dysfunction.

*Reflection:*
I stay in close contact with GEICO’s technology officers.
Surprisingly, alignment between policy and grassroots still pushes through a resistant middle. +
Struggles continue.
The mindset spreads — repo by repo.

I still hear from engineers there — asking questions, seeking advice.
I take engagements like this to better understand the problems of the American enterprise economy.
And I keep learning.

Like this:
_When executives yield to the will of the collective without transparency, the result is always a runaway program._
That _always_ can be proven. But only by looking _inside out_, not _outside in_.

.Mutual of Omaha and the Moment They Owned It
====

*Context:*
ASE Inc. was contracted to provide the board a transformative roadmap — and then take the first domain team through their private journey.
But by the time I arrived, transformation had already begun.

*Approach:*
Before our first workshop, teams were already meeting.
Modeling. Sharing diagrams. Debating decisions.
Tania’s framing of a “shared practice” had caught fire.
I coached one team in DDD, pairing, CI/CD — not just the techniques, but the posture.
They didn’t resist. They waited. Then they leaned in.

*Turning Point:*
One morning, I walked in to find them pairing without prompt, rewriting their own backlogs, and gently debating what “clean” really meant.
They were drawing their own aggregates.
Not because I asked — but because they needed to.

*Result:*
They no longer needed me to lead.
Nor did the others.
Within weeks, discovery workshops and architecture sessions were team-driven.
This wasn’t mimicry. It was ownership.

*Legacy:*
Mutual of Omaha didn’t just buy a paper from ASE.
They read it. Understood it. Adopted it.
Especially the part about building a “virtual team” — the Community of Practice.

That CoP grew from a few participants to over 40 contributors.
Its repo, artifacts, and mindset became internal references.
Leadership appreciated it. But more importantly, **the engineers owned it.**
They didn’t just ship a better product.
They shipped a better way of working.

.Deutsche Bank and the Weight of Trust
====

*Context:*
At Deutsche Bank, I was tasked with leading the architecture and delivery of dbECM
— a global content and record system to serve 13 business domains, with 100% of enterprise content flowing through it.

*Problem:*
Most systems die from scope. This one had too much trust.
It needed to scale across continents, survive infrastructure failures,
and serve every team — without becoming a bottleneck.
We couldn’t afford fragility, centralization, or dependency.

*Solution:*
We built dbECM as a self-healing, API-first,
tenant-aware platform with governance and SDLC pipelines encoded at the root.
Its test-first, domain-segmented architecture allowed each of the 56 apps onboarded to remain independent
— while inheriting resilience.
CI/CD wasn’t a layer. It was the operating principle.

*Result:*
dbECM became a global standard.
It outlived political changes, infrastructure rotations, and platform shifts.
We didn’t just build content storage.
We built organizational memory — that didn’t depend on memory.

*Legacy:*
dbECM still runs. Quietly.
Its architecture became a blueprint.
Its fully automated ops became dbSDLC — a model for _all_ systems.
Because its stability allowed teams to focus on business — not survival.
Which, in the end, is what trust really means.

=== Core Lessons from the Field

Tau and the Ledger of Trust::
Even when the architecture holds, a system can still betray its original purpose. +
*_Mission must outlast funding._*

MATILDA and the Governance That Builds Itself::
You can’t manage complexity through consensus — You govern it through design. +
*_Structure is the real policy._*

GEICO and the Speed of Vapor::
In systems built on optics, integrity looks like delay. But holding the line builds foundations. +
*_Restraint is an engineering discipline._*

Mutual of Omaha and the Moment They Owned It::
You can lead a team to the edge of change. But they have to take the step themselves. +
*_Transformation is collaborative._*

Deutsche Bank and the Weight of Trust::
When you build something people can count on, they stop talking about it. +
*_Trust is when systems disappear._*


== What I Teach by Living

* Code is conversation.
* Architecture is trust.
* Velocity is a trailing indicator of clarity.
* The only thing that scales is how you think.

I build systems that survive their first user.
And teams that survive their first rewrite.
