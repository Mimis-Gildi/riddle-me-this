Who This Is For::
This is not a resume about creativity. +
_It is a resume that *creates understanding*._ +
Understanding of what it means to build systems that last, +
teams that think, and software that speaks truth in production.

[.normal]
This is not a design piece. It is a leadership artifact —  for those who want to know how I see the work, +
why I lead the way I do, and what it means to be an engineer who builds real assets. +
Not capital. Not headcount. +
_But *clarity, confidence, trust, and delivery*._

[.lead]
[.text-justify]
The most valuable assets of any successful and modern business are not software, hardware, data,
infrastructure, or even uniquely innovative and competitive market strategies
-- these are just products of a creative mind. +
*_The most valuable asset is always just people._* +
_Yet a person is always both an asset and a liability._ +
Our competence makes us an asset. +
Our incompetence — often just hidden bias — makes us a liability. +
What, then, is the highest product an experienced engineer can produce?

[.lead]
I give you: _productive, competent, and **creative Domain Teams**._

[.quote]
Corporate Deathtrap: _"What have you done for me now?"_ +
Corporate Salvation: _"What have you done for yourself now?"_

_All the knowledge, methods, and tools that we need to build a bright future are already here. +
What remains is *US* choosing to use them. Choosing to use them wisely, creatively, and productively._

== How I Become an Asset

- Solve _fundamental_ problems instead of creating them.
- Use hard-earned _competence_ instead of politics.
- Lead _others_ creating own assets within themselves.

What have I learned from three decades of fieldwork?::

* Most systems don’t lie maliciously — they just never had a chance to learn the truth.
* Tools reflect thinking. Bad tools reflect bad thinking left unexamined.
* Test-first isn’t just about safety — it’s about narrative integrity.
* Most teams don’t fear failure — they fear looking incompetent in front of politics.
* Software design is culture design — nothing more and nothing less.
* Culture change doesn’t begin with trust — it begins with shared language.
* You can’t fix delivery until you fix what people think they’re delivering.
* The best leaders aren’t brave — they’re precise, relentless, and honest.

.Tau and the Ledger of Trust
====

*Context:*
A major medical university approached us to build a secure system that would return control of health records to patients
— bypassing Epic, and eventually, third-party insurance.

*Setup:*
The doctors’ vision was idealistic and righteous: _privacy, transparency, sovereignty_.
They brought funding, letters of commitment, and the belief that if we built it, trust would follow.
I believed in the mission — and insisted on its integrity.

*Runway Zero:*
We built Tau: a secure, Kotlin-based edge system on top of Cardano (ADA).
Functional, elegant, and abstracted for survival from the first commit.
At its core: a blockchain-backed, one-time authorization token, implemented as a smart contract.
It let patients define who could access their data, when, how often, and for what purpose.
My team in Prague multiplied our velocity. We shipped.
I held the line on ethics as tightly as on architecture.

*Reality:*
Idealism doesn’t sell. The market pushed back.
Epic controlled the optics. The doctors lost their savings.
The hospital withdrew. The system was never breached, but it was never adopted.
And no one called it a failure — but no one touched it again.

*Repurposing:*
To protect the doctors' investment, I engaged a longtime collaborator — a founder-whisperer.
He reframed Tau as a legacy vault for the ultra-wealthy.
No code changed hands. Only the mission did.
I replaced the Haskell-based Cardano backend with a custom DAG written in Kotlin.
The architecture held. The value proposition shifted — dramatically.

*Disappointment:*
I had hoped Tau might return — reborn for everyone.
Freemium models and scaled subscriptions have democratized much harder ideas.
But when offered profit and exclusivity, the doctors declined to open the vault.
Posterity, it turns out, is not a universal right — only a luxury offering.

*Legacy:*
Tau lives on — lavishly. Not for patients.
For the preservation of privilege.
The product is stunning. The code is clean.
The conscience is, still, conflicted.

The blockchain core leveraged Haskell.

Todo...


I write code that earns its place in the real world.
I help teams fall in love with doing it honestly.
I’ve been hands-on in startups, governments, banks, pharma, defense — and every one of them thought their dysfunction was unique.
It wasn’t.

This is what I’ve learned in 35 years of fieldwork — thinking, making, shipping, and returning with fewer illusions.




== Tau and the Lie of Self-Sovereignty

Tau was born from the righteous rebellion of Duke physicians who wanted patients to own their destiny — not just their data.
They funded a distributed ledger to dethrone Epic’s MyChart.

I wrote it in Cardano.

Then Duke blinked.
Money vanished.
The idea didn’t.

A new backer emerged — one who didn't want sovereignty for the people, but posterity for the privileged.
I rewrote the system in Kotlin, using a custom DAG block structure.

The code survived.
The intent didn’t.

'''

== MATILDA and the Myth of Collective Code

Thirteen organizations. One codebase. Shared stewardship.
Everyone wants governance. No one wants accountability.

So I wrote the governance into the CI.

The system holds — not because of meetings — but because the code refuses to build without consensus.

They still call it a coalition.
I call it a code contract with teeth.

'''

== What I Teach by Living

* Code is conversation.
* Architecture is trust.
* Velocity is a trailing indicator of clarity.
* The only thing that scales is how you think.

I build systems that survive their first user.
And teams that survive their first rewrite.

'''

== Ask Me About

* What prod-parity really means
* How to build archetypes that survive adoption
* Why DDD without language is just domain-flavored layers
* How a CoP becomes your org’s immune system
* What I do when the system lies

'''

== If You Must Know

- BS in Computer Science – UNCP, NC
- PSU EE coursework
- 35 years in production
- Still writing. Still pairing. Still learning.
