Polyglot software engineer, hands-on architect, and player-coach with 35 years of experience in system design,
distributed architecture, and high-performance delivery across startups, Fortune 500, eCommerce, and the public sector.

Deep practitioner of Extreme Programming (XP), Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and DevOps culture —
guided by competence, a *production-first mindset*, and a love of clarity, innovation, and sustainable systems.

Brings transformational value to corporate America with a honed ability to lead **policy-down and grassroots-up**.
Aligns _executive vision_ and _engineering implementation_ across all levels of accountability.

Known for::
- Building consensus from strategy to delivery with collaborative domain-discovery modeling
- Architecting shared journeys that evolve policy and culture — grounded in reality, not jargon
- Leading multidisciplinary contributors through hands-on, trunk-based design and delivery
- Coaching XP champions — from business leaders to developers — on the test-first mindset path
- Nurturing Communities of Practice (CoPs) into viral cultures of innovation delivering on policy
- Empowering advanced, cross-functional teams to field *AI-augmented DDD Aggregates*

_Drives transformation through *nurture*, *example*, and outcome *ownership*.
Helps others fall in love with the art of engineering —
and earn leadership through the long strategy of thinking, making, and shipping._
