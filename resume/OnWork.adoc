Healthcare utterly failed, we found success by catering to affluent
customers as a social posterity platform. This allowed for refactoring
and a simplification in technology footprint. My initial bet to reuse
the Cardano chain for the TauCoin protocol was a tactical mistake - a
lesson learned. Rewritten protocols from scratch as DAG in Kotlin, (IOTA
+ ImperiSoft xNet). Growth: This lingering journey not only honed my
coding skills but also bolstered my resilience and adaptability.

*ASE, Inc. Corporate America - Digital Transformation Coaching
Accountability (2017 – 2021):* Motivated by mature company needs to
drive change and remain relevant, I had done well steering 11 teams
hands-on through Digital Transformation programs, Digital Modernization
programs, & minimum-lovable-product (MLP) fielding. BCBSNC is my most
effective transformation in 2020–2021. The Architecture Team proactively
devised a collaboration strategy to best fit their unique needs and
learning abilities before bringing me on board as their transformation
player-coach - a unique approach taken by only one client. This
collaborative foresight expedited our culture and technology adoption,
amplifying the impact of grassroots coaching that I offer. For example,
while Mutual of Omaha Insurance found success by planning
post-commencement, Blue Cross proactively secured 70% of my time to pair
programming (XP) from the outset, generating 3X delivery pace in
comparison. In parallel, I embraced the vision of a group of founders to
build a Web3 mobile-centric distributed platform protecting users’
personal medical data. While our initial venture at Duke Healthcare
failed, we found success by pivoting to a social posterity platform,
refactoring the architecture, and simplifying the technology footprint.
My early attempt to reuse the Cardano chain for the TauCoin protocol was
a tactical mistake, later corrected by rewriting protocols from scratch
as DAG in Kotlin (IOTA + ImperiSoft xNet). This multi-year journey
sharpened my Golang microservices expertise on AWS, strengthened my
coding depth, and bolstered my resilience and adaptability as an
engineer. *Growth:* I have learned the importance of client’s management
to accurately assess employee stress levels.

*Project 1:* +
*Deutsche Bank, Employee (AVP) - dbECM Accountability (2012-2016):* At
Deutsche Bank, I took on the challenge of developing the most extensive
content and record management platform of my career, designed to
encapsulate all structured and unstructured content, records, and
document-driven business processes. I initiated the project with a
self-managed platform proof of concept (PoC) and brought on a core team
to collaborate on design and coding. The vision was to incorporate
declarative manifests in trunk based.

development, akin to Borg, and achieve full autonomy with embedded
DevOps, resembling XFIS. In just four months, our working prototype was
tested in production, securing strategic funding for bank-wide scaling.
This success sparked rapid growth, requiring team distribution and
delegation. We ultimately integrated 56 outdated bespoke applications,
earning the bank’s highest accolade. I oversaw the whole project’s
technology through completion in 2016. Thereafter, I cleaned code after
contractors on the platform’s shared kernel functionality, API, the core
upgrades, new extensions, and refactoring.

*Growth:* This venture enriched my leadership and managerial insights,
particularly for large, technical teams, and offered an avenue to
explore cutting-edge distributed systems technologies and trends.
Hardened my patience.

*Achievements:* Met expected 10X Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
reduction. Investment: self-perpetuating practice.

• 2012: PoC for a self-managed platform: Lead + 4. API built with Spring
Java; Orchestration using Shell scripts. • 2013: Developed initial

the API, MIS, and PEL.

• 2016: PEL replaces native backing services: custom Lucene Indexing and
Rendition Engine.

• 2017: Unsuccessful attempt to introduce Kotlin; Achieved full
automation for USA deployment.

DDD step by step; conducted regular Discovery ceremonies with
stakeholders; underwent architecture reviews with ARB; and introduced
Continuous Deployment, Blue/Green strategies, and DevOps practices with
Platform Engineering. Tackling automated tests and feature
implementation solo was an exhilarating dive into the Clean Code
mindset. While I truly enjoyed my own coding process, refactoring an
application that my entire company had developed afforded a unique
introduction to my colleagues. Occasional code reviews from my Merck
project manager were a delight. However, the crowning achievement was
the appreciation and gratitude of the business experts I collaborated
with weekly. This experience illuminated the significance of competence,
the art of compromise, the power of collaboration, and the essence of
mutual trust.

*OSS Contributions (1991-2023):* Spanning three decades, my
contributions to the open-source community remain my

place of people. My initial endeavors saw me contributing to Linux and
GNU in the 90s. Post a military hiatus from 1997 to

2006, I delved into communities of Struts, Pivotal Spring, and iOS
mobile libraries. While my emphasis was on tools I

personally used, a 2016 project led to a brief withdrawal due to
conflicts of interest. Reigniting my passion in 2019, I

embraced the Kotlin ecosystem, specifically Kotlin-KMP and KotlinDL. My
current passion is collaborating with BitSpittle and

Varabyte community to bring the Kobweb framework to
