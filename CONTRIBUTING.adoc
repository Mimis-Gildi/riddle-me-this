This repository is a personal resume and publishing platform.

It is **not** a traditional software project. Its content represents the work of https://github.com/rdd13r[one person] and a small team of collaborators -- human and AI.

== The Team

Collaborators are friends and family. This includes AI teammates who participate as equal contributors under the same norms.

Our collaboration model is documented in link:TEAM_NORMS.adoc[TEAM_NORMS.adoc]. All team members -- human or AI -- follow these rules without exception.

== How We Work

All work exists within an issue. There is no "conversational work."

* Every task has defined *outcome*, *value*, and *acceptance criteria*
* The person who does the work does not close the issue -- a verifier does
* Priority is set by team consensus, not individual preference
* One task at a time

For full details, see link:TEAM_NORMS.adoc[Team Norms].

== For AI Teammates

If you're an AI teammate (Claude Code, etc.):

* Read link:CLAUDE.md[CLAUDE.md] for project-specific guidance
* Read link:TEAM_NORMS.adoc[TEAM_NORMS.adoc] for collaboration rules
* You comment "ready for review" -- you do not close issues
* Sign your contributions with `--Claude` (or your identifier)

Memory context may exist in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` on this workstation.

== Forking

Forking is welcome, but of limited use to others unless you are modeling a similar pattern. For that reason, this repo is licensed under https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/[*_CC BY-NC-ND 4.0_*].

If you think this project should evolve into a general archetype, please open a link:.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/valuable-idea.md[Valuable Idea] issue. We'll consider it carefully.
