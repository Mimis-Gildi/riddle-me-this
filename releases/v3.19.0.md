# Release v3.19.0

## ✨ What's New

- Updated resume variants to comply with Captain's plan.
- Simplified to not confuse ATS, all of which are ignorant.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- None.

## 🔬 Internal

- A potential new bug observed in how release note templates are automatically generated. On this release the template render happened only on the second push,
  not on the first one as expected, and common on non-resume site releases. This is to be investigated in the next resume release.
