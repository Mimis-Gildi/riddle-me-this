# Release v3.19.0

## ✨ What's New

- Updated resume variants to comply with Captain's plan.
- Simplified to not confuse ATS, all of which are ... ig-naaa-nt.
- First use of release override. v3.19.0 was published twice.
- And then a third time to the same trunk - no problems!

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Community adoc linter broke OnEngineering.adoc. Modified linter.

## 🔬 Internal

- A potential new bug observed in how release note templates are automatically generated. On this release the template render happened only on the second push,
  not on the first one as expected, and common on non-resume site releases. This is to be investigated in the next resume release.
- Rolled back release and version. Release processes used community linter which has a bug. Since this is trunking workflow - needed to clobber auto-promote as
  well.
- Let's see how release override works: we never had to use it before 😜!
