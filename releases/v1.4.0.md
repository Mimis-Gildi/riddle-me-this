# Release v1.4.0

## 🧬 Major Codacy Refactor & Full Static Analysis Hardening

This release introduces a fully restructured Codacy integration that simplifies configuration, improves maintainability, and ensures proper multi-language support aligned with Codacy’s latest standards.

---

### ✨ What's New

- 🔧 Codacy centralized configuration via `.codacy.yaml` (repository root).
- Adopted latest Codacy spec, including correct engine names and YAML structure.
- All scanners now controlled declaratively — no more hardcoded GitHub Action steps per tool.

- 🚀 Full multi-engine coverage:
    - `eslint-8` (JavaScript/TypeScript)
    - `shellcheck` (Shell scripting)
    - `markdownlint` (Markdown docs)
    - `prettier` (Formatting)
    - `bandit` (Python security)
    - `semgrep` (Meta static analysis)
    - `detekt` (Kotlin-native static analysis)
    - `pmd-7` (Java/Kotlin hybrid scanning)

- 🔥 Kotlin support fully activated via `detekt`, `pmd-7`, and `semgrep`.

- 🧹 Exclusion rules updated:
    - Ignored: `.github/`, `.idea/`, `.run/`, `.saga-notes/`, build artifacts, vendor directories, node_modules, test folders, minified assets, etc.

- ⚙️ Repository Analysis backend prepared:
    - Requires enabling "Repository Analysis" feature inside Codacy UI for full cloud integration.

---

### 🧪 Improvements for maintainers

- 🎯 Simpler onboarding for new tools via `.codacy.yaml`.
- 🎯 Future-proofed configuration model against Codacy deprecations.
- 🎯 Single Codacy CLI invocation inside GitHub Actions — no workflow duplication.
