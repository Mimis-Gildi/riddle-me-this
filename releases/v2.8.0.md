## 📝 Release Notes for `v2.8.0`

### ✨ What's New

- **Runner Introspector**:  
  Introduced a robust, version-aware introspection action to validate:
    - `SDKMAN!` presence, version, native daemon match
    - Full SDK matrix (Java, Kotlin, Scala, SBT, Gradle)
    - Ruby toolchain (Ruby, Bundler, Gems)
    - Conda ML environment and Python/Mamba
    - Reports are annotation-based, fault-tolerant, and output-rich  
      *(See: `.github/actions/introspect-runner/action.yml`)*

- **Split GitHub Pages Workflows**:
    - Separated `build` and `deploy` phases by runner label for performance and agent isolation
    - `github-pages-jekyll-build.yml`: runs on labeled Jekyll-capable agents
    - `github-pages-deploy.yml`: deploys via dedicated self-hosted infra with `pages:write` access
    - Shared GEM environment configured across builds for speed and cache integrity  
      *(See: `.github/workflows/github-pages-*.yml`)*

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Removed duplicate Gem declaration in `site/Gemfile`
- Injected `site_version` into `_config.yml` and fixed formatting edge cases
- Copyright:
    - Dynamic footer version update based on release tag
    - Normalized spacing with resilient `sed` substitution

### 🔬 Internal

- Activated introspection on all agents via `custom-runner-introspect.yml`
- Enhanced all workflows with:
    - Strict concurrency guards
    - Minimal permissions (`contents:read`, `pages:write`, `id-token:write`)
    - Agent-specific optimization and version traceability
- Added fault-tolerant checks for hosted runners: OS, kernel, CPU, memory, and GitHub CLI state
- Switched to `zsh -l {0}` across the board for uniform shell expectations
- Hardened runner introspection:  
    - `SDKMAN!` presence, version, native daemon match
    - Full SDK matrix (Java, Kotlin, Scala, SBT, Gradle)
    - Ruby toolchain (Ruby, Bundler, Gems)
    - Conda ML environment and Python/Mamba
