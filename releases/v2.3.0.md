# 📦 Release `v2.3.0`

## ✨ What’s New

- 🔄 **Canonical Semantic Tagging**  
  Introduced `extract-component-version-and-tag` action to reliably derive release tags from `gradle.properties`.

- 🛡️ **Branch Discipline Across Workflows**  
  All workflows now guard against unsafe execution paths using `feature-fail-fast`.

- 🚀 **Smarter Release Logic**  
  GitHub Releases can now conditionally attach résumé PDFs and auto-create semantic tags if missing.

- 🧠 **Strict Release Note Validation**  
  Prevents publication of placeholder/boilerplate content, enforcing editorial review before release.

- 🧰 **Seeded Release Notes Templates**  
  Added `.github/templates/release-notes-template.md` as canonical boilerplate to support the validation system.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- 🐞 Fixed PR label race condition between reader and writer workflows.
- ⚠️ Guarded against false positives in `resume` label checks.
- 🛠️ Refined tag creation to prevent redundant pushes.
- 🔧 Corrected token scope issues in label inspection steps.
- 🧪 Removed misleading defaults from CI truth expressions.

## 🔬 Internal Enhancements

- 🧱 Modularized logic across reusable composite actions for versioning, tagging, commits, and release orchestration.
- 📈 Injected commit logs and file diffs into autogenerated release notes.
- ✳️ Cleaned up YAML formatting and standardized naming conventions across the board.
- 🔁 Followed a strict 5-phase pattern for each new feature: create ➝ refactor ➝ test ➝ integrate ➝ validate.
- 📴 Muted non-core workflows during testing permutations to reduce noise.
- 🧾 Validated all negative-case paths for logical completeness and trace coverage.

## 📂 Artifact Locations

- 🧾 **Release Notes**: `releases/v2.3.0.md`
- 📄 **Résumé PDF**: (conditional on `resume` label)
- 🔐 **SECURITY.md**: now tracks the latest canonical version
- 🧭 **All references updated**: `README.adoc`, `site/index.adoc`, `maintainer.adoc`
