# 🚀 Release v2.5.0 — *Cyber Volunteers, Final Transmission*

## ✨ What's New

- **Final Part of AI Indies Series**  
  Published *AI Indies Part 4 – Cyber Volunteers in Ukraine*, completing the 4-part analytical journey that began in 2022. <br/>
  This installment explores U.S. vulnerabilities, the Ukrainian cyberwarrior doctrine, and the systemic failure of American defense against modern warfare <br/>
  — psychological, algorithmic, and kinetic.<br/>
  Orc should not be able to harm us. But it does! So then, how exactly?
- **New Revolution Article Collection**  
  Introduced `/revolution.adoc`, a new long-form post only available on the personal blog, offering unabridged, unfiltered reflections for fellow hackers and thinkers. <br/>
  This serves as a capstone and call-to-arms for builders resisting the decay of Western competence.<br/>
  And the section contains the articles conveniently together.
