# 🚀 Release v2.7.0

## ✨ What’s New

- **🚦 Introduced a full suite of custom GitHub Actions** for modular release management, labeling, versioning, and environment validation:
    - `detect-runner-type` – detects self-hosted vs hosted runners
    - `introspect-runner` – emits detailed annotations of runtime toolchains
    - `release-notes-create`, `extract-commits`, `write-notes` – automate semantic release documentation
- **🧠 Canary-Style Introspection**: Added `custom-runner-introspect.yml`, a push-triggered self-hosted runner probe that logs full toolchain presence, shell, OS, Conda, SDKMAN-managed JVM stack, and Ruby environments via annotation.
- **📒 Custom labeling actions**: Improved `check-pr-labels` and `check-issue-labels` to enforce workflow triggers via GitHub label contracts.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- 🐚 Fixed a GitHub Actions shell resolution limitation (zsh not recognized in some hosted contexts)
- 🪄 Resolved multiple rounds of “Saga hallucinations” with accurate context injection and introspection stability
- 💡 Prevented annotation loss from dynamic shell evaluations in runner environment detection

## 🔬 Internal

- 🧹 Consolidated and tagged all reusable actions under `.github/actions/`
- 📜 Rewrote runner introspection to emit `::notice title=...` for all properties
- ⚙️ Tuned all workflows with clearer naming, logical grouping, and fallback readiness
- 🧪 Completed migration to Mimis dedicated runners with introspection-confirmed setup
- 🧼 Added host-level self-cleaning and debug tools for safe validation and pruning
- 🪄 Standardized release notes generation via `custom-release-notes-generator.yml`
