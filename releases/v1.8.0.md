# Release v1.8.0

## ✨ What's New

- Introduced Stale Issue Watchdog automation.
- Added scheduled workflow for automatic issue and PR inactivity management.
- Fully configured grace periods for issue staleness, PR staleness, and controlled closures.
- Integrated GitHub's `actions/stale` with safe branch targeting for your workflow patterns.
- Added clean matching for your GitHub flow branch naming (`[0-9]*-*` pattern).

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- None required for this iteration — stable implementation on first drop.

## 🔬 Internal

- Expanded automation scaffolding to cover future stale-tracking metrics.
- All stale action labels pre-created for safe operation: `stale-issue`, `stale-issue-closed`, `stale-pr`, `stale-pr-closed`.
- Generator remains fully idempotent across multiple PRs.
- Release notes system maintains full deterministic overwrite model.
