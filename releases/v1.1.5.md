# 📥 Vadim Kuhay – Résumé Collection `v1.1.5`

This pre-release contains the curated résumé suite of Vadim Kuhay — known on the scene as `rdd13r`: creative engineer, hands-on coach, DDD tactician, and hacker of legacy systems (both organizational and technical).

These are not just job summaries.
They are _field artifacts_ from a 30-year engineering journey — delivered with intentionality, depth, and clarity of craft.
