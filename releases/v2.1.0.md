# Release v2.1.0 — Canonicalization Phase One

---

## ✅ Summary

This release brings the **first canonicalization pass** over migrated publications, applying standardized scaffolding, cross-publication linking, and attribution patterns across early articles. This stage establishes fully uniform parametrization, stable link references, and site-internal consistency for long-term maintainability.

## ✅ Scope of Changes

### 📝 Article Migrations & Renames

- `2023-06-25-new-ooprtunities-with-ml-1a.adoc` → renamed → `2023-06-25-new-opportunities-with-ml-1.adoc`
- `2023-06-25-new-ooprtunities-with-ml-1b.adoc` → renamed → `2023-06-25-new-opportunities-with-ml-2.adoc`

### 📝 Article Refinements

- Fully adopted cross-publication boilerplate (`{ff-li-current-article}`).
- Internal prior-article crosslinking via `{ff-prior-article}` with parametrized URLs.
- Parameterized all external references (`:gov-start:`, `:sba:`, `:score:`, `:geomotiv:`, `:cleveroad:`, `:youteam:`, `:start-small:`, etc.)
- Audit and normalize image links (`image::/riddle-me-this/assets/images/...`) to conform with site assets structure.
- Verified proper image anchors, captions, and float alignment.
- Spelling corrections on key typos:
    - *"Jenuinely"* → *"Genuinely"*
    - *"custmer"* → *"customer"*
    - *"oportunities"* → *"opportunities"*

### 📝 Metadata Consistency

- Parametrized newsletter and publication links (`:li-newsletter:`, `:li-current-article:`, etc.)
- Adopted uniform excerpting and category tagging.
