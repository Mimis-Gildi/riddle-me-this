# Release v1.6.0

## ✨ What's New

- Introduced fully automated release notes generator scaffold.
- Implemented seed phase: generates release file from version bump.
- Implemented injection phase: appends commit logs and file lists since previous tag.
- Switched release notes format to deterministic stateless design.
- All release notes fully reproducible from Git state — no embedded state tracking.
- Clean separation of Logs and Files sections for human inspection.
- Full release notes engine now integrated with reusable composite commit action.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Resolved prior fragile parsing of release file footer.
- Stabilized GitHub Actions multiline output handling.
- Eliminated prior dry-run conditional failures.
- Normalized branch safety checks.
- Fixed inconsistent quoting and shell evaluation issues.
- Corrected output propagation across workflow steps.

## 🔬 Internal

- Composite actions fully wired and reusable for other automation pipelines.
