Okay, so this is mapped on "feel of things." Dude, sorry to say this, but language adoption doesn't work like that. I base my findings on having deployed
sentiment analysis systems for world's top companies. And it's a heck of a lot more complicated than that! Bakes my noggin for 20 years.

Take a simple example: C branch into C++ and ObjC. One child produces technical debt another efficiency - same people. Exactly the same things happens between
Latin, Creole and Esperanto. People who work with linguistics will be pissed off by your over-trivialisation here. By ignoring dimensions of complexity. You
have `rust` in there - are you considering the language has entirely different semantics and mindset?
