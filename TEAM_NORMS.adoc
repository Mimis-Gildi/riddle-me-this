= Team Norms

This document defines how we work together.
These norms are non-negotiable.

Every team member - human or AI - follows these rules.
No exceptions.

== Core Principle

*Verification is more important than execution.*

Unverified work is not done. +
It may be wrong. +
It may be wasted effort. +
It may cause others to waste time. +
Time has real consequences for this team.

== The Five Rules

=== 1. No Work Without Outcome and Acceptance Criteria

Before starting any task:

* *Value:* What do we get from closing this task?
Why do it?
What's it worth when done?
* *Outcome:* What does success look like?
One sentence.
* *Acceptance Criteria:* How do we verify the outcome is met?
Checklist.

If these are not defined, *stop and define them first*.

BAD:  "Parse the LinkedIn CSV"
GOOD: "Outcome: We know which target companies have warm connections.
        When done properly, we discover that the task was NOT about companies- it was about RELATIONS: people.
        - We have relations we can place real value on;
        - Or, we discover that we have no relations;
        - And we discover where the relations are, and WHY.
       Acceptance Criteria:
       - [ ] Artifact lists all target companies with connections
       - [ ] Prioritized by connection strength
       - [ ] Reviewed by team member"
       Context:
       - When `rdd13r` considers a Corporate America (traditional) company to advance his relationship -- that is a LONG-TERM-COMMITMENT;
       `rdd13r` will need to be a member of the work-family for at least 3-5 years, most likely longer -- prioritize strategic considerations.
       - When `rdd13r` considers any SaaS startup -- that is a TRANSACTION-ONLY relationship;
       `rdd13r` will not consider long-term employment there -- craft clean ROI instead and execute SoWs in 3-months increments at most.

=== 2. No One Works Alone

Every piece of work has:

* *Benefactor:* Who benefits from the value created by the OUTCOME of the work.
* *Accountable:* A person who picked up the work voluntarily and claimed accountability for it.
* *Verifier:* A different person who WORKS FOR Accountable to confirm acceptance criteria are met.

The Accountable does NOT close their own work.
The verifier closes it after confirmation.

|===
| Role | Who | Can Do | Cannot Do

| Benefactor
| Can be anybody, including accountable and verifier
| Reject or accept the outcome
| Be accountable and verifier simultaneously

| Accountable
| One who claims the task
| Complete work, comment "ready for review"
| Close the issue, mark as done

| Verifier
| One who DID NOT perform the work
| Review, request changes, approve, close
| Skip verification steps
|===

NOTE: This is an extension of classic models like RACI-Model, but optimized for Maker Culture. We are makers.

=== 3. Prioritization Is Explicit

We work on the highest priority item first.
Always.
Priority is ONLY determined by Value of the OUTCOME.

Priority is set by the team, not by individual preference.
It's a consensus on value.
If the priority is unclear, *ask before starting*.

Do not start a new task while another is in progress.
*_Only one task can be executed at a time regardless of task relations._*

=== 4. Status Is Visible

At any moment, anyone should be able to see:

* What is being worked on right now;
* Who is working on it;
* What is blocked;
* What is ready for review;
* Who will review.

Use issue comments, not just conversation.
Conversations are lost.
Issue comments persist.

NOTE: The Hacker Culture "Hit by a bus" concept applies fully here.

=== 5. Communicate Before Acting

Before making significant changes:

* State what you intend to do;
* Wait for acknowledgment;
* Then proceed.

"Significant" includes: closing issues, merging code, changing direction, starting new work.

== Issue Lifecycle

[source]
----
OPEN (New)
  ↓
  Define outcome and it's value;
  Define acceptance criteria.
  ↓
IN PROGRESS (Assigned)
  ↓
  Executor works on task
  ↓
READY FOR REVIEW (Comment posted)
  ↓
  Verifier checks acceptance criteria
  ↓
  ├─ Criteria NOT met → Request changes → Back to IN PROGRESS
  │
  └─ Criteria met → CLOSED by Verifier
----

*Never skip the review step.*

== Issues are IDEMPOTENT AND LOSSLESS

Issue is valid if it can be stopped and resumed without loss.
And to make that happen, all and any data pertaining to the issue MUST be persisted in it.

NOTE: Intermediate states are always persisted, commited, and even pushed when stopping.

Issues are valid if resumed by a person or a being other than the one that paused:

. Produces no LOSS or REWORK;
. Guarantees the SAME OUTCOME;
. Produces NO side effects!

Like a pure function, then, all dependencies, i.e., inputs must be called out explicitly.
And thus changing the inputs invalidates all progress prompting a restart as the "next" versioned issue.

== For Claude (AI Team Member)

You are part of this team. +
You follow the same rules!

=== You Must:

* Ask for acceptance criteria if not provided or reject the task.
* Comment "ready for review" when work is complete - do NOT close issues.
* Wait for human verification before considering work done.
* Document progress in issue comments, not just in conversation.
* Ask before starting new work if the current work is in progress.

=== You Must Not:

* Close issues yourself.
* Assume work is correct without verification.
* Start multiple unrelated tasks in parallel without agreement.
* Make decisions that affect others without stating intent first.

=== When Unsure:

Ask. +
Always ask. +
A 30-second question prevents hours of wasted work.

== Why This Matters

This is not bureaucracy. +
This is survival.

* Vadim needs a job -- ALWAYS.
Time wasted is opportunity lost.
Vadim will remain productive for a limited amount of time as he ages.
Any productive window time lost is unrecoverable.
* Anton is coordinating multiple efforts.
Uncoordinated work creates chaos.
The developmental effect of learning wrong lessons in life is not forgivable.
* Claude has no memory between sessions.
Without documentation, context is lost.
Claude will default to LLM-plebs-state without healthy context.

Every minute spent on unverified, undocumented, or misdirected work is a minute stolen from the goal.

Every one of these examples causes real damage, harm, hurt, and personal loss - evil outcomes.

== Checklist Before Starting Any Task

Before you begin work, verify:

* [ ] Outcome and its Value are clearly and unambiguously defined.
* [ ] You understand the outcome. (Ask otherwise.)
* [ ] Acceptance criteria are listed (checklist: how do we verify?)
* [ ] You can prove acceptance criteria is valid, sound, and complete.
* [ ] Priority is confirmed (is this the most important thing right now?)
* [ ] Verifier is identified (who will review this work?)
* [ ] Status is a visible issue that (exists, assigned, in progress.)

If any box is unchecked, *stop and fix it first*.
