    "# Stages of Customer's Enterprise Architecture\n",

    "This notebook contains stage diagrams for the first non-technology company we encountered that moved seemingly through all four stages of AI-Native transformation,\n",
    " entirely on their own only using ASE and a handful of other peers as architectural guides, subject-matter experts, and the sounding board.\n",
    " The engineering team at this company surpassed initial expectations from 2018 digital transformation program.\n",
    " The business software teams continued to grow, almost doubling in size, evolve, and iterate over business domain models.\n",
    " The documentation practices of this team are exemplary: architecture with code, architecture as code, define through tests and socialize.\n",
    " The most interesting evolution is that the team is using both the modular monolithic structure they were left with,\n",
    "  and some of the most modern elements of distributed system architecture like microservices and microfrontends in amalgamation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my professional opinion this team surpasses Expedia Group innovation culture despite having shared no OSS components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we celebrate their achievements by documenting their architectural decisions and practices."
