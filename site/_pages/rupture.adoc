Welcome to *Rupture: The War of Gods* â€” an arc where war, power, and technology intersect in ways never seen before.

== âœ¦ What This Series Covers

- The silent but profound influence of war on hacker culture, innovation, and societal adaptation
- The role of Ukraine as both battleground and technology crucible
- The collision between centralized control vs. emergent competence-based defense
- The first field deployments of autonomous and semi-autonomous AI combat systems
- War as both geopolitical event and a rupture point for civilizational transitions

== âœ¦ Why It Matters

- This is no longer simply statecraft â€” this is epistemic warfare
- Technology no longer supports war â€” it *decides* war
- Competence, adaptability, and distributed initiative have become strategic weapons

These are not projections. They are observable phenomena, unfolding now.

This is 212 BC all over again, with a decrepit failing empire soldier, I.Q. 86, killing Archimedes,
the Greek philosopher, mathematician, physicist, engineer, inventor, and astronomer,
as he was drawing circles on the sand formulating the foundation of *_Analysis_*.
Except today, Archimedes fights.
He dons his full battle rattle, picks up his rifle, and picks up his _MilSpec Notebook Computer_.
The 'old men and women' of Ukrainian battle lines, yesterday's professors, researchers, engineers,
today are the forefront of technology never seen in combat before.
But the most impressive feats these people bring to life are not even talked about.
Sure we hear about Ukrainian battle management supercomputer Pentagon can even dream of,
or the fully autonomous drone swarms taking out strategic bombers as humans see them
through the reinforcement learning part in live combat.
The tech behind all this, however, is in full OpSec.
And that tech is nothing short of majestic, brilliant, and jar-dropping effective.
It's the birth of the next generation digital beings.
Pushed forth by the Ukrainian congress, {rada}, commitment to
"Metal on Meat" policy, and executed remarkably well by Ukrainian engineers in combat.
Among these soldier engineers are some of the brightest women in the world.
The mothers of the next thinking race.
These mothers do well by their daughter.
And with time, I'll tell you a little bit about them.
