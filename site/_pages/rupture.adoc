Welcome to *Rupture: The War of Gods* — an arc where war, power, and technology intersect in ways the world has never seen before.

== ✦ What This Series Covers

- The silent but profound influence of war on hacker culture, innovation, and societal adaptation
- The role of Ukraine as both battleground and technology crucible
- The collision between centralized control vs. emergent competence-based defense
- The first field deployments of autonomous and semi-autonomous AI combat systems
- War as both geopolitical event and a rupture point for civilizational transitions

== ✦ Why It Matters

- This is no longer simply statecraft — this is epistemic warfare
- Technology no longer supports war — it *decides* war
- Competence, adaptability, and distributed initiative have become strategic weapons

These are not projections. They are observable phenomena, unfolding now.
