:foot-llm-job-scare: footnote:[A reflection on how my `Merica, dozing at work and in personal life, is startled by the LLM ChatBots, and then immediately freaked out for losing a job to a machine -- an honest and candid reflection to how Americans see their own competence -- {llm-jobs-scare-craze}.]

_Reflections_ is the context group where I slow down and take the long way home.
