Welcome to *The Fall of Democracy* — an arc tracking the quiet erosion of democratic institutions under technological stress.

== ✦ What This Series Covers

- The accelerating mismatch between governance and exponential technology
- Rent-seeking bureaucracies co-opting both regulatory and public discourse mechanisms
- Weaponized AI-driven narrative control, algorithmic censorship, and information warfare
- The rise of state-corporate surveillance economies
- The collapse of institutional competence and the paralysis of decision-making

== ✦ Why It Matters

- The structures that once enabled democracy now undermine it
- Technology amplifies both truth and manipulation
- Governance architectures are rapidly losing ability to regulate the very systems they depend on

We are not watching hypotheticals. We are watching governance fail in real-time.
