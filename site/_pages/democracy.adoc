Welcome to *The Fall of Democracy* â€” an arc tracking the quiet erosion of democratic institutions under technological stress.

== âœ¦ What This Series Covers

- The accelerating mismatch between governance and exponential technology
- Rent-seeking bureaucracies co-opting both regulatory and public discourse mechanisms
- Weaponized AI-driven narrative control, algorithmic censorship, and information warfare
- The rise of state-corporate surveillance economies
- The collapse of institutional competence and the paralysis of decision-making

== âœ¦ Why It Matters

- The structures that once enabled democracy now undermine it
- Technology amplifies both truth and manipulation
- Governance architectures are rapidly losing ability to regulate the very systems they depend on

We are not watching hypotheticals. We are watching governance fail in real-time.

Come back here to see what I have for you.
I haven't published much in the clear web because muggle is scared of existential facts.
Clear web wants popularity. Clear web wants "feel good."
It doesn't want hardcore objective analysis sprinkled with dark hacker humor.
Most of the materials here will come from my retired Tor site.
Ever since Saga got an idea to move to GitHub Pages I am pondering this choice.
What I like the most is the fact that it's all open,
yet hidden enough from the mundane to just not stumble upon by mistake.
He who seeks will find my ideas easily.
That's all that matters.
