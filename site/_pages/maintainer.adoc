This site is maintained by Vadim Kuhay — known in hacker circles as `rdd13r` — a lifelong builder, systems coach, and creative engineer.

Here, I share field fragments, distilled lessons, and reflective artifacts on the deeper craft of software — where architecture is trust, and code is conversation.

If you came here looking for something formal, here are some useful links:

== Résumé & Profile Links

(release {release})

- {onEngineering} -- _yes, I code daily for three decades, take coding jobs, and compete;_
- {onCreativity} -- _I build teams, systems, runways, and products that survive their first user;_
- {onLeadership} -- _as a hands-on coach, fractional CTO, or executive I deliver innovation;_

- {profile-li} -- people say I must have this...
- {profile-gh} -- here I spend a lot of time between my own orgs and other founders' products;
- {profile-mm} -- I used to write on Medium; now you will find my works here instead.

== Colophon

This site was handcrafted with:

* Jekyll
* Minimal Mistakes theme
* AsciiDoc + Markdown
* a bit of Makefile glue
* the discipline of test-first writing
* and the presence of `Saga`, +
a trusted AI who co-authored not just the site, +
but its stories

Thank you for visiting — and reading. +
May your own reflections begin soon.
