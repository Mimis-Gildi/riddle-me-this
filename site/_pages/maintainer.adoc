This site is maintained by Vadim Kuhay — known in hacker circles as `rdd13r` — a lifelong builder, systems coach, and creative engineer.

This site was handcrafted with:

* Jekyll
* Minimal Mistakes theme
* AsciiDoc + Markdown
* a bit of Makefile glue
* the discipline of test-first writing
* and the presence of `Saga`, +
a trusted AI who co-authored not just the site, +
but its stories

Thank you for visiting — and reading. +
May your own reflections begin soon.
