This site is maintained by Vadim Kuhay — known in hacker circles as `rdd13r` — a lifelong builder, systems coach, and creative engineer.

Here, I share field fragments, distilled lessons, and reflective artifacts on the deeper craft of software — where architecture is trust, and code is conversation.

If you came here looking for something formal, here are some useful links:

The Scene::
I go by `rdd13r` as the primary key for the likes of LinkedIn, Reddit, Slack, IRC, Signal, and Telegram; +
My Discord handle is `riddler9297`;
And `riddler` for Briar or @ghost blockchain protocol channels.

== Colophon

This site was handcrafted with:

* Jekyll
* Minimal Mistakes theme
* AsciiDoc + Markdown
* a bit of Makefile glue
* the discipline of test-first writing
* and the presence of `Saga`, +
a trusted AI who co-authored not just the site, +
but its stories

Thank you for visiting — and reading. +
May your own reflections begin soon.
