Welcome to the *Final Industrial Revolution* — where technology ceases to be merely "tools" and becomes wetware augmentation.

== ✦ What This Series Covers

This arc explores the rise of:

- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Multimodal expert systems
- AI-driven augmentation of human cognition
- The dissolving line between "worker" and "augmented knowledge agent"
- Cloud-scale ecosystems and emergent infrastructure patterns

We follow real-world implementation stories — not theoretical speculation. You will find case studies from startups, high-risk experiments, corporate laggards cautiously dipping their toes, and sometimes, magnificent failures.

== ✦ Why It Matters

- Entire classes of work are being rewritten
- Hacker culture is colliding with AI culture
- Competence gaps are widening as wetware augmentation amplifies the skilled

This is not science fiction. This is production reality — now.
