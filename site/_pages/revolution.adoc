Welcome to the *Final Industrial Revolution* â€” now technology isn't merely "tools"  â€” but wetware augmentation.

== âœ¦ What This Series Covers

This arc explores the rise of::
- *_Large Language Models_* â€” still rather shallow but already enabling stronger models;
most catered to tool markets, but already few have the right idea.
- *_Integrated MLops platforms_* â€” the inevitable push to trunk-base evolution of ML applications;
a silver bulled for self-modifying systems; the crucible is here.
- *_Multimodal expert systems_* â€” resurrection of the _Real Artificial Intelligence,_ the science,
applied in construction of genuine thinking machines â€” now we can.
- *_AI-driven Augmentation of Human Cognition_* â€” this is my favorite topic, something I do for more than two decades,
today we don't just apply models to DDD Aggregates,
a simple feat most corporate American laggards still resist,
we apply models as agents directly to policy governing body over sheeple herds.
- _The dissolving line between "worker" and "*augmented knowledge agent*"_ â€” this is mere side effect of something much more prominent about to emerge.
- _Cloud-scale ecosystems and **emergent infrastructure patterns**_ â€” I will share a little bit of magic for what to come next. Muggle tool mentality fielded a ton of buzzwords for the last poser yapperdom. What has just surfaced completely erased the boundary between that which can be buzzed out and that which can't.

We follow real-world implementation stories â€” not theoretical speculation. Case studies here come from startups, high-risk experiments, even corporate laggards cautiously dipping their toes, and sometimes, magnificent failures. This section here is squarely dedicated to the code discipline excluding warfare applications. The magnificent Valhalla part has its own section.

== âœ¦ Why It Matters

- Entire classes of work are being rewritten with impact on the Social Contract previously not seen.
- Hacker culture is colliding with AI culture and molding into something entirely new and powerful.
- Competence gaps are widening as wetware augmentation amplifies the skilled and marginalizes mundane.

This is not science fiction. This is production reality â€” now. nd it takes on the life of its own, literally.
