_Adventures_ is where the work takes form -- in the field, in the code, in the culture.

These stories come from a lifetime of making systems for humans, machines, and the space in between.
Some are tales of hard-won production deployments.
Others are snapshots of transformation: a team that leveled up, a policy that finally landed, a system that refused to die quietly.

They are not case studies.
They are _narratives with teeth_.

You’ll find no sanitized slide decks here -- only work done under pressure,
in motion, and sometimes under duress.

When names are changed, it’s not to obscure the truth --
it’s to protect the living systems that run, and the people still inside them.

== Selected Field Notes:

_The ones that still echo._


The last two years, I've been focusing on AI-Native weapon systems abroad.
Now I'm back -- so, what about AI-Native Corporate America?
Surely, we all have self-driving cars, all the tellers are robots, and AI caters to our every need.
Right? Wait, what?

2025/08/07: {business-2025-08-07-ai-success-story} -- 'AI don't need no clouds.' +
2025/07/21: {business-2025-07-21-ai-integration-architecture} -- this is _not_ how we saw the future in 2023. But here it is, in its full glory. +
2023/07/05: {business-2023-07-05-ai-integration-trap} -- the four phases of AI-native evolution -- validated by life itself. +
2023/07/04: {business-2023-07-04} -- the impediment is known -- our vendors will surely beat it!
Right-right?
WRONG!

These are the short stories behind the current CTO avalanche.
Maybe it's for the best.
