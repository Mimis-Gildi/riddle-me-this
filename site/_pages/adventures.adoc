_Adventures_ is where the work takes form — in the field, in the code, in the culture.

These stories come from a lifetime of making systems for humans, machines, and the space in between.
Some are tales of hard-won production deployments.
Others are snapshots of transformation: a team that leveled up, a policy that finally landed, a system that refused to die quietly.

They are not case studies.
They are _narratives with teeth_.

You’ll find no sanitized slide decks here — only work done under pressure,
in motion, and sometimes under duress.

When names are changed, it’s not to obscure the truth —
it’s to protect the living systems that still run, and the people still inside them.
