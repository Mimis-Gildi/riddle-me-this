Welcome, friend. I'm glad you're here.

My name is Vadim D. Kuhay -- known on the scene as `rdd13r` since 1992.
I'm a system designer, player-coach, and hands-on engineer with over three decades in the field,
across startups, Fortune 500 giants, defense contracts, and public good.
Here is everything about me -- I lead an open, inclusive life.

I build systems that survive their first user
-- and teams that survive their first rewrite.

== What I Do:

I practice *Extreme Programming*, *Domain-Driven Design*, and *DevOps culture* +
{nbsp} -- not as buzzwords, but as disciplines. +
I help organizations align policy with practice and transform by example, +
not decree.

I architect platforms, mentor engineers, coach domain teams, and push production-first delivery +
in environments that *_often_* resist it.
My work lives in systems you‚Äôve probably used
-- though the best ones are invisible
-- such is the simple nature of servitude software.

Most importantly, I nurture open co-mentoring communities of thinkers and makers.

== Why I Do It:

- Because software is how we tell the truth -- at scale.
- Because when teams share language, they move faster -- and think better.
- Because the only thing that scales is how you think.

Oh, and because I was born to engineer the world a better place. +
I do this regardless of money.
Just ask mother Athena.
üòâ

== Where It Leads:

This site contains fragments of my story:
lessons from the field, case studies, reflections, +
and some resume material.
If any part of it speaks to you +
{nbsp} -- personally, technically, or philosophically +
{nbsp} -- I welcome the connection.

You can find me in production, in conversation, or in the stories I leave behind.

== ...another thing,

I'm also a founder.
But realistically, every hacker is
-- since long before the MIT Model Railroad Club.

If you're a hacker too, and the mundane talk above didn‚Äôt impress you, +
look for me in bonded warehouses; or DRMO.

A hacker knows what that means.

== Who I write for?!

- Other founders looking for communities or mastermind groups;
- Leaders at **500‚Äì2,000**-person companies shipping real products;
- Traditional business Domain Operators:
* **Industrial & Manufacturing**,
* **Financial Services/Fintech**,
* **Logistics/Supply Chain**,
* **Healthcare Ops**.
- People in decision-making roles:
* **CTO, VP Eng, CIO, COO**,
* Operations Staff+ Architects,
* Heads of Data/ML.

_**Not** a fit for_: green-field PR pilots or ‚Äújust fine-tune it‚Äù work with no integration ownership.


== ...oh, and one more thing.

I am a parent who homeschools his kids.
My 15-year-old son went through public schooling until high school
-- Wake County public education system is considered the best in the nation.
Most likely I will also homeschool my 2-year-old daughter. through her high school years when she gets there.

This is our non-religious academically-focused school{footer-captain-school} on GitHub: {captain-school}.

If you are a homeschooling parent focusing on holistic development of your child, +
I'd love to talk to you and compare notes.
Our child is graduating from high school early. +
And that presents its own dilemmas to ponder over.
