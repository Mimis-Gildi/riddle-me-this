Welcome, friend. I'm glad you're here.

My name is Vadim Kuhay — known on the scene as `rdd13r` since 1992.
I'm a system designer, player-coach, and hands-on engineer with over three decades in the field,
across startups, Fortune 500 giants, defense contracts, and public good.

I build systems that survive their first user
— and teams that survive their first rewrite.

== What I Do

I practice *Extreme Programming*, *Domain-Driven Design*, and *DevOps culture*
— not as buzzwords, but as disciplines.
I help organizations align policy with practice and transform by example, not decree.

I architect platforms, mentor engineers, coach domain teams,
and push production-first delivery in environments that *_often_* resist it.
My work lives in systems you’ve probably used
— though the best ones are invisible
— such is the simple nature of servitude software.

== Why I Do It

Because software is how we tell the truth — at scale.

Because when teams share language, they move faster — and think better.

Because the only thing that scales is how you think.

== Where It Leads

This site contains fragments of my story:
lessons from the field, case studies, reflections, and some resume material.
If any part of it speaks to you
— personally, technically, or philosophically
— I welcome the connection.

You can find me in production, in conversation, or in the stories I leave behind.

== ...one more thing

I'm also a founder.
But realistically, every hacker is
— since long before the MIT Model Railroad Club.

If you're a hacker too, and the mundane talk above didn’t impress you,
look for me in bonded warehouses.

A hacker knows what that means.
