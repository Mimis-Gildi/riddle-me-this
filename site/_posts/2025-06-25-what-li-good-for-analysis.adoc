In https://mimis-gildi.github.io/riddle-me-this/reflections/2025/06/24/what-li-good-for.html[my previous post], I wrote about our daring experiment on LinkedIn.
Let’s now unpack what we actually learned from it.

== First, a Little Bit of Scepticism...

Everyone -- except Joe -- was a little skeptical of his results.

Joe saw steep network growth.
At one point, he even hit the *first-degree connection limit*.
All within a year.
But here’s the paradox:

- He didn’t write any of the content himself.
- He didn’t engage meaningfully.
- He didn’t sell or pitch anything.

We assumed this couldn’t be happening from simple automation -- unless something *unusual* was at play.

The other two test subjects didn’t show anything noteworthy.
So we turned our focus to the Sycophant.

== Validating the Data?!

Joe kept his data, as required by the experiment.

My son and I -- with some help from David and John -- set out to validate his logs.
A couple days, a Jupyter notebook, and several cups of coffee later, we arrived at a startling discovery:

**Joe didn’t cheat.**

The foundation of the experiment was clear: a human must be able to *replicate the behavior manually* in ~1 hour of focused activity.

Joe’s app generated 115–155 events per day -- fully within an hour’s worth of focused, choreographed effort.
That’s 1/10th of the daily API limit.

== So How Then?

That’s when the real research began...

== Plausible Hypotheses (Debunked)...

Here’s what we *thought* might be going on -- and what we ruled out:

* **Shadow Botnet Boosting** – Our primary suspect.
Debunked via logs.
* **Group Synergy / Sidekick Boosting** – Trolls often get boosted by their little gangs.
But Joe had no consistent sidekicks.
* **Platform-Primed Role Bias** – We suspected LinkedIn inherently favors the "Suit" archetype.
But many real-life sycophants showed flat growth.
* **Positive Engagement Bias** – Joe’s posts were mildly positive.
But they were also LLM-generated and boring.
No correlation.
* **Intent Subversion** – Maybe Joe "salted" the robot by engaging manually.
Nope -- logs show Joe was way too lazy for that.

So... what then?

== Real Results -- What Now?

We ran a black-box *open-system* experiment.

Here’s what it revealed:

. **LinkedIn can be gamed** -- easily and in spectacular fashion.
. **The platform rewards mimicry** -- not substance.
Simulated behavior outperforms authenticity.
. **Persona ≠ Identity** -- LinkedIn rewards *persona projection* over who you really are.
. **If we had added a leech, it would’ve been perfect.**

__This is all fine. And kind of obvious.
But what is *really* going on here?
And for that we need to look inside.
Grab the real *root cause* -- the only variable that matters.
Is that just the *sycophancy*?
__


== A Thousand 'Whys' to the Rescue.

When I coach teams, I teach the 5-Why method. So that’s what we did. And it helped.

Everything stemmed from early analysis by MATILDA ("Tillie") in 2021 -- that's where the puck started moving for Joe.
You see, Tillie is a *Higher-Order Distributed System* -- she spawns autonomous Agents, each with its own lifecycle.
Think *Akka Actor System*, but truly distributed and decoupled.

Joe liked that idea.
So when he built his "Lazy LinkedIn User App," he designed AI agents to simulate *social persona behavior*.
And each vector, a total of eleven in the end, was a completely independent agent of its own,
driving a completely separate crosscut concern.

So far, so good.

But the interesting part?
The *feedback loop tuning* that kicked in during months 3–4.
And here we'd noticed the brilliance of Joe's approach -- some of the crosscuts were about fleeting appeasing of followers.

What we didn’t realize right away was that Joe’s robot *did* have sidekicks -- just not *permanent* ones.
They rotated in and out, like NPCs in a well-tuned simulation.
Except these were real people, unaware LinkedIn users, not realizing they're interacting with a machine.
This makes for a first human being that is a robot sidekick if I ever saw one.
A total over 300 in the course of the last 7 months.

This made me think of a Russian poser I knew at Deutsche Bank.
He called himself a "political shark" and spent all his time brown-nosing directors.
He had a sidekick and a knack for gossip -- and no actual contributions.
But he *rocketed* up the ranks.
Because Deutsche Bank had a thick, gooey middle-management layer -- and that’s exactly what the system was built to reward.

Turns out, **Joe built the same thing** -- only better.
Just like the Russian poser at DB found himself between two directors arguing and ended up playing both sides, so did Joe's robot.
On several repeated occasions over and over again, Joe's robot would end up passing small tokens between 2 arguing "executives" and drawing attention to itself, especially if a `troll` was also involved in the exchange.
This didn’t just simulate an ordinary "suit", i.e, sycophant.
This simulated a more complex behavior of a typical aggressive "middle manager" that is "looking for growth" and is willing to "go an extra mile for the company".
*ROFL!*

_We were stunned to realize how little intelligence was required to make this Middle Management Rock Star happen._

**A perfect, self-tuning Middle Manager.** -- And LinkedIn *absolutely loved it!*
Both from the human and the algorithmic perspective.
I hope that you are realizing that *_there is no blocking this behavior!_*
There is NOTHING LinkedIn can do to stop such a natural exploit.

== Final Takeaway - Yay!

So what’s the real way to game LinkedIn? How about, don't game LinkedIn -- game people on it: build a sleazy middle manager.
How did this work for Joe? Currently we estimate it this way:

* 60% Platform dynamics: algorithmic feedback loops, signal boosting, gamification.
* 40% Human psychology: social proof, sycophancy reward systems, fear of standing out.

*What was Joe's Middle Manager doing well?*

* Say the right things but not too strongly.
* Cheerlead publicly.
* Praise up and sideways.
* Never offend.
* Appear busy and aligned, but not too independent.
* Mirror success behaviors.
* Repeat parasitic phrases.

*The resulting value is this:*

. *Didn’t challenge norms.* (_like a hacker always would_)
. *Generated safe, bland positivity.* (_like a hacker never would_)
. *Engaged just enough, in #safe ways#.*

_Tracked what worked and *doubled down* — not on truth, not on authenticity, but on *perception*!_

*Why did LinkedIn love it?*

* Non-controversial PLUS emotionally positive.
* Is consistent and persistent in rhythm.
* Shows growth (likes, comments, connections).
* Triggers other people to engage (even briefly).
* Avoids disapproval (flagging, unfollowing).

_How lame, right? -- but that's the best LinkedIn can code up right now. Wait for more AI, perhaps._

*Why did People love it?*

_Whoa, and this depends on "which people?" The majority of people on LinkedIn, i.e, "LinkedIn People" are:_

. Reward-seeking, validation-hungry.
. Afraid of being wrong.
. Politically sensitive (in both meanings of "politics").
. Quick to align with what seems popular.

I have explicitly checked for this behavior posting about POTUS and factual YET controversial events.
*_The above four (4) traits are the ABSOLUTE for 96% of LinkedIn users._*

Joe’s bot surfed the human need for safety, consensus, and tribal validation.
It fit in. It looked successful.
And people -- being LinkedIn people -- reacted to the #*mask*#, not the man.
Sure, there was a real man behind the profile, but by now less that 0.01% of
the "friends" have actually met Joe.

And that's how one owns LinkedIn.

*Any thoughts?*

. What do you think about bots on LinkedIn?
. What is the difference? Can you tell?
. What does this mean for YOUR future on LinkedIn?
. What can LinkedIn do to stop this behavior?
. Are they already trying to stop it?
