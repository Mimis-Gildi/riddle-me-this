In my {previous-article-url}[previous article] I wrote about a long-lost client who called back to share an astounding story{footer-previous-article}
-- attaining Phase III of AI-Native evolution in two years.
I was amazed because I remembered their architecture: Modular Monolith.
But soon it made sense -- they had clean boundaries, so adding AI magic was purely incremental for them.

Here I'll describe their astounding financial gains from Phase I alone.

== Why Your AI Fails (And Theirs Doesn't)!

Your AI can't tell the difference between a customer order and a lunch order.
Origami's AI predicts market demand with 80% accuracy.

The difference?
They taught AI their language FIRST.

While you're wrestling with chatbots that hallucinate, Origami gained:

- Sales prediction accuracy: 10% ‚Üí *70-80%*; üéâ
- Operational cost reduction: *17%* in Phase I alone;
- AI integration failures: *Zero*!

How?
They had something you don't: *Corporate Taxonomy*.

**Corporate Taxonomy = Teaching AI exactly what every word means in YOUR business.**

Not Wikipedia definitions.
YOUR definitions.

== The Magic Started in 2018 (Before Anyone Cared About AI):

It all began with creating Corporate Taxonomy (CT).
From CT, we get an automatic Enterprise Dictionary.
Let me explain what CT is and why it changed everything.

Remember, Origami makes high-precision hydraulic power transfer components. +
Boring?
Maybe.
Profitable?
Absolutely.

They have three main customer types:

* **Integrators** -- build bigger machines using Origami parts (predictable, planned);
* **Maintainers** -- fix industrial machines, need parts NOW (unpredictable, sporadic);
* **Explorers** -- design new machines, want custom components (expensive, disruptive).

In 2016, all these different needs funneled through one "Front Office." +
Chaos. *_Expensive chaos_*.
Order was the first necessity.

And here's where it gets interesting...

== Corporate Taxonomy: The Secret Weapon!

Corporate Taxonomy classifies business _objects_ AND *behaviors*. +
This is the magic that makes AI integration seamless. +
And it's exactly why 80% of corporations fail miserably with LLMs today.

Let me show you with a simple example -- an Order.

In CT, every artifact has:

* **Name** -- unique identifier
* **Type** -- classification
* **Attributes** -- data/state it owns
* **Policies** -- business rules it follows

Here's what Origami's base business object looks like:

[source,yaml]
----
com.origami.BusinessObject:
  parent: null
  name: Object
  api: v3.1.7
  policies:  # Runtime immutable
    - name: Creation
      type: com.origami.policy.OnCreate
    - name: Modification
      type: com.origami.policy.OnModify
    - name: Delete
      type: com.origami.policy.OnDelete
  attributes:
    required:
      immutable:
        - name: id
          type: UUID
        - name: created
          type: Instant
      operational:
        - name: modified
          type: Instant
        - name: description
          type: com.origami.data.RecordList
----

Look at the *order* and predictability! +
Every business object follows these rules. +
Now here's their Order object:

[source,yaml]
----
com.origami.Order:
  parent: com.origami.BusinessObject
  name: Order
  api: v11.1.0
  attributes:
    required:
      immutable:
        - name: origination
          type: com.origami.data.crm.Record
      operational:
        - name: disposition
          type: com.origami.data.ChainOfCustody
        - name: reconciliation
          type: com.origami.data.Reconciliation
----

The boundaries AI needs are already visible. +
But let me make this crystal clear with a restaurant example everyone understands.

== The Restaurant Order: Same Word, Different Meanings:

When you sit down at a restaurant, an Order is born.
But here's the magic:

- **To the Waiter**: Order = table number, items, special requests, payment;
- **To the Cook**: Order = items to prepare, special instructions, timing;
- **To the Manager**: Order = revenue, table turnover, inventory impact.

Same order.
Different meanings.
Different contexts.

*This is what your AI doesn't understand and why it fails.*

Each domain has its own private meaning for shared words.
The waiter doesn't care about inventory.
The cook doesn't care about payment methods.
But it's the SAME ORDER.

Quick question: *_When is an order "closed"?_*

- When payment is collected?
- When the customer leaves?
- When the bank settles?
- When quarterly books close?

Think about it.
Your answer reveals how confused your own business language is.

== The Enterprise Dictionary: Your AI's Rosetta Stone.

Unlike Webster's, an Enterprise Dictionary shows:

- Base definition: "Order = business event including a sale";
- Waiter's definition: "Order = table service request";
- Cook's definition: "Order = production queue item";
- Accountant's definition: "Order = revenue transaction".

See how this makes everything trivially simple for AI? +
And not just AI -- humans understand better too!

== The Accidental AI Preparation:

Here's the beautiful part: Origami wasn't preparing for AI. +
They were just trying to run their business better.

Two key changes created magic:

1. **Corporate Taxonomy** -- everyone knew what everything meant.
2. **Public API** -- customers could self-serve.

This caused:

- **Inversion of Concern**: Customers pulled data instead of calling in (commands ‚Üí queries).
- **Segregation of Control**: Each domain owned only its piece of the order lifecycle.

Costs dropped.
Efficiency soared.
I collected my check and left. +
*Little did I know...*

== The AI Explosion: One Tiny Change, Massive Impact:

Years later, when AI arrived, Origami's team made one brilliant addition:

[source,yaml]
----
com.origami.BusinessObject:
  attributes:
    required:
      immutable:
        - name: id
          type: UUID
        - name: created
          type: Instant
        - name: context  # <-- THE MAGIC
          type: com.origami.DomainContext
----

See what they did?!
*They made context mandatory!*

Every business object now carried its complete meaning.
Not just data -- MEANING.

Clever, isn't it?!

== Phase I Results: The Numbers Don't Lie!

They started simple -- added AI to the order placement boundary. +
Remember those three customer types? +
The ordering portal was a nightmare of complexity.

First enhancement: An LLM on the ordering edge. +
Result: The "unpredictable" became predictable!

By analyzing order patterns with context, they discovered:

- Raw material prices;
- Interest rates;
- Geopolitical events.

These three factors explained ALL fluctuations. +
And they also discovered why -- customers hoard!

**Sales prediction accuracy jumped from 10% to 70-80%.**

Imagine the manufacturing efficiency gains! +
Imagine the inventory optimization! +
Imagine the cost savings!

All because every object carried its complete context.

== What This Means for YOUR Company?!

**If you have:**

- **Spaghetti architecture**: 6-12 months to build taxonomy first.
- **Some boundaries**: 2-3 months to document *_necessary_* context.
- **Clean architecture**: 2-3 weeks to add AI (like Origami).

**Every month you delay:**

- Competitors get further ahead.
- Your AI projects keep failing.
- Your costs stay high.
- Your predictions stay wrong.

**The brutal truth:** You can't skip this step.{footer-cto-trap}
And NO vendor can sell you a shortcut.

== The MCP Bonus Round:

When {mcp-overview} arrived, Origami just... rolled it out. +
No drama.
No rearchitecting. +
Their context-rich taxonomy fit MCP like a glove.

While you're having vendor meetings about "AI transformation," they're in Phase III.

== The Two Keys to AI Success:

After 30 years of building systems, it comes down to this:

. **Semantic Consistency** -- Every word means ONE thing per context;
. **Boundary Enforcement** -- Contexts don't bleed into each other.

That's it.
That's the magic.

Your vendors won't tell you this because they can't sell it in a box. +
(Or, they don't know.)

Just think about it -- you want AI to do your business for you. +
Can it get up and walk around trying things out like your employees do? +
No?!
Then how would it know what you want it to do?

== What's Coming Next:

Phase II is where it gets REALLY interesting -- AI agents start talking to each other across boundaries.
But that only works if Phase I is rock solid.

I'll cover those exponential gains in my next article.
But first, ask yourself: Does YOUR business even have a common language?
(Or, what is _Ubiquitous Language_?)

If not, every AI dollar you spend is wasted -- LLMs are "Language" models, aren't they?

== The Uncomfortable Conclusion:

Everything we've discussed is just *_Systems Engineering_*. +
... But notice how natural it feels in business terms?

That's because people -- specifically people's behaviors -- ARE part of the system! +
I've always designed systems with humans at the core.

Until now.

The world just shifted.
For the first time in human history, we can build different systems. +
Systems where digital minds understand context as well as humans do.

Maybe better.

But only if you teach them your language first!
