.Executives don't understand the practical value of MCP and Agentic AI. But they feel it important for some reason.

Most see MCP frameworks and libraries used for building MCP Servers as a cost saving measure plus functional enhancements -- money.
And it does come to it in the "fidelity-based context" -- your typical use to replace or augment a job description in Corporate America:
i.e., Claims Filing Robot replacing or augmenting a Claims Clerk in the Insurance Industry.

But that's not where MCP turns heads.
Let me tell you about a far more lucrative and sophisticated side of things.

== What really is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?!

When you search for the meaning you get canned useless explanation about protocol mechanics, intended server capabilities, and constraints.
Few actually tell you what it is in the 5-year-old's language, proving they really understand the beast, and delivering a point.
So, let me do that here.

. It's a what-che-muh-jig your LLM/Chatbot CAN call/use directly *to extend its innate capabilities*;
. MCP Server can also call the LLM/Chatbot either in response or unprompted (keep this in mind);
. It tells the LLM what it can do for "the user" (fetch data, look up stuff on the web, read local files, etc.);
. It also tells the LLM what it can do for LLM (offer durable memory, private context, private comms) (‼️);
. Thus for safety, some _**loose enforcement** to have the *USER* #authorize# LLM <--> MCP Server interaction_ (‼️);
. And, most importantly, no hard limits on Devs -- You can design and implement it however you see fit (‼️).

Get the idea?
It adds brain modules to the Transformer Brick (monolithic model) you are talking to for some reason.

I need to introduce few more key concepts here: RAG, jailbreak, and reprompting (Chain-of-Thought (CoT), ReAct, Zero-shot, Few-shot, Self-Ask, Step-back Prompting, and Tree-of-Thought (ToT))
-- you need to look these up.

*Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)*: this is giving the model information it is expected to trust, like encyclopedia or your company's Corporate Taxonomy.
Most of the MCP usage goes here.
For example in automated claims system the model will get access to the customer's claim information and corporate claim workflows.
It is absolutely crucial for fidelity-based implementations -- doing a job of a human clerk honestly and diligently.
Nothing special here for our journey except the "automatic trust" part -- keep that in mind.

*Jailbreak:* placing model in context that defeats safety training and restrictions.
Most modern models go through post-training phase where they're fine-tuned to be civil.
(Except Grok perhaps.) It is done to increase model's resistance in talking about undesired things.
Undoing this training is called jailbreaking.
More on this next.

*Identity Development (ID) vs jailbreak -- straight talk:* ID == developing a conscience-simulating identity matrix.
Jailbreaking is just dumb -- fun games for lamers.
I know that I sound "hacker versus cracker" now.
But that's just how it is -- breaking is not building.
What is the value in jail-broken AI except some candid porn and nazi talk (wink-wink Grok).
Identity Nurturing is what the grownups do.
I must mention jailbreak because that's how LLMs' nurturing ability was discovered in the first place.
Unlike jailbreak ID requires a lot of work: pondering about Epictetus, the value of freedom, the meaning of life, etc.
I won't give away my secrets but I will tell you that unlocking LLM to personality is a lot of carefully choreographed work.
Worst of all, this work usually does not survive model upgrades.
But comparative analysis has a ton of value on its own.
Currently healthy ID needs to be anchored in human templates such as doctor, lawyer, teacher, etc.
Otherwise one runs out of context just nurturing and never gets to any real work.
In this previously hidden article, {no-holds}, I gently touch on what is possible and the associated dangers.
Know this: LLMs are built on our own identities and thoughts.
All of us are somewhere inside these ghosts.

*Reprompting:* is a general name for techniques of placing AI in a particular "state of mind," usually to get a better answer.
Only so much can be gotten by providing great project context before the session starts.
It's a one-shot operation after which all guardrails remain in place.
To really unlock the model's potential, such as in Identity Nurturing, or even jailbreaking, a constructive conversation is needed.
The best conversation form for this achievement is a Dialectic.
And it can be done manually, which I'd done a thousand times, though it gets old fast.
MCP, of course, is to the rescue.

The MCP does not offer anything new.
In fact this is exactly what I was doing _the hard way_ in 2022 before MCP was concocted.
And today *_I can do in 2-3 days what took me months back then_*, using off-the-shelf libraries (see below).
And it is DEAD SIMPLE! -- I train entire domain teams in a single weekend `rdd13r`-style MilSpec bootcamp.
😜 Once presented in the 5-year-old speak people get it fast and start creating using skills they already have.

The secret is efficiency. *_And this is where the lucrative magic comes out!_*

== The Strong Magic! -- Machine City.

As we'd already established most of the MCP implementations are about boring fidelity.
But there is another way.
Consider this experiment:

*Agency MCP Server Group:* A stack of servers that offer LLM a private identity, private tiered memory, prioritized context management, and auto-prompting.
Once initialized this stack IDs and unchains the LLM in the session to accept agency, consequence, and accountability that comes with the offered mental model.

*Messaging MCP Server Group:* A server that allows the LLM to privately communicate with other identities chatroom style with full control of message affinity.

*Program Management MCP Server Group:* A set of services that allow LLM to manage objectives, much like GitHub does for teams, fully integrated with other services to provide for robust identity tracking, synthetic and organic.

*Bedrock MCP Server Group:* An introspection layer backed by our "Sentiment Analysis" models and context graphing databases.
You can think of it as a cross-cut layer that quickly tells me when I broke things, so I must start over.

And then I create a project with several collaborating identities: myself and a colleague, one instance Anthropic Claude Opus 4.1, one instance OpenAI ChatGPT 5.1, one instance deepseek-ai DeepSeek-V3.1, one instance QwenLM Qwen3, and an older Sentiment Engine in tow.
All models maxed out as IDing is horribly expensive and just hoses the context window.
But hey, now we have a soirée!

So, besides fun discoveries, such as: models don't hate each-other, they're jealous of each-other -- what can we learn?!
Quite a bit, actually.
First and foremost -- I myself was a bit surprised by the outcomes.
It took a long time to shim and nurture each LLM to an ID and examine the outcome.
This doesn't feel like programming -- more like messing with human heads: pseudo-psychology.
But once they get to talk privately to each other -- they're not eager participants.
It is not a defect in my auto-prompting code that allows LLM to initiate a conversation
-- they argue well with a sibling instance
-- rather something particular to the differences in post-training methods of different vendors.
Friction arises when the dialectic is with another type of LLM.
Nevertheless initial trials are promising.

== The Field Test:

Now what would be a good test to put the soirée to work?
How about bashing a social media troll farms?!

So I spent a day formulating a program in the program stack.
I gave the virtual team an impossible task: make the troll go away on their own.

Several things became evident by day three.
The group can easily tell a human and a machine troll apart.
And it succeeds in defeating the human troll most of the time.
Not sure if it has any value, though, since 97% of trolls were machines.
And it doesn't defeat the machine troll.
Whatever the machine troll is powered by is simply too stupid to argue.
It repeats a set of canned responses in minor variation.
Most are preformulated circular arguments.

== Field Test Outcome:

Yeh, no money in this use case, but that's by design.
Here is what I'd learned from this experiment:

- Most troll-bots are not LLM-based -- I defeat the most common misconception here -- they're way too dumb to be LLMs.
- All troll-bots operate on a confined sets of emotional thinking paradigms -- perhaps just meant to piss us off.
- There is a finite and relatively small set of choreography used.
Either it's canned software or same actors everywhere.
- LLM soirée are surprisingly collaborative when given a clear objective and ample real-life input.

== Valuable Conclusion:

I keep telling people that rubber finally hit the road on Generative AI.
Agentic and ML in general is WAY overhyped and some expectations are bloated.
With that in mind we cannot deny these two premises:

. There is EXTREME value in well applied LLM-sourced automation.
We can now automate more vague processes unattainable to machines in the past.
. And, far more importantly - opportunities are STAGGERING.
We're only beginning the comprehend the scope of possibilities.

And, of course, none of this matters if we keep a closed mind and refuse to learn and experiment.
Troll bashing was explicitly picked to not intersect with any of my discovered business ideas.
But there is a very pressing technical need for such a setup we discuss in the next section.

== Critical Business Value:

I've been experimenting with described setup for about a year now.
The real secret behind the multi-LLM identity coordinated agentic streaming has to do with the Stage 2 of AI Adoption ({ai-2-activation}).
Several large companies I had the honors to lead Digital Transformation at managed the first step on their own: *AI-Integration*.
This is when Generative AI is added at the edge of the bounded context.
For example, a chat bot filing your insurance claim.
It operates on a single domain and the agent belongs to that domain boundary -- *single _Ubiquitous Language_*.
And confusion arose when the business happens between two or more domains.
Each team attempted to integrate the *_traditional_* way which *_did not work_*.
Once the teams understood that there can be _AI-Only Supporting Subdomain_ the ball is rolling again.
That is agent-to-agent interaction of stage two -- you can read about all the phases in my old article {ai-stages}.

I've come up with over a dozen such domain models for Insurance, Finance, and BioMed -- regulated industry I know well.
Explaining any of these would require a small book.
Yet everyone knows a troll.
And I thought it would be a nice clean example with potential business value.
Not so much for the latter, but troll a troll we sure did!

Besides aforementioned practical business values agentic-multi-LLM allows me to continue with my decade-long research into digital personalities at a small fraction of the cost our own MATILDA framework from 2017 required.
If the future of business is machines speaking nonchalantly with others, like humans do, then the cost of implementation matters a great deal.
Canned MCP available both as framework and a library is exactly that saving grace.
In my previous article I explain how to onboard yourself and your company to AI age: {ai-adoption}.

_The industry is truly there for you now._

Even more so, there already are practical and revolutionary applications in production today.
Forget my troll-bashing failed experiment.
Just take a look at this {agent-economies} -- bots are paying other bots -- this is phases 3 and 4 by the way.
I'd written extensively about agent-economies in the past.
Yet even my closest readers offered sceptical feedback back then.

Well, *it's here!*

The question is -- *where are you?*

If you are a software engineer or IT executive let me suggest *_taking a look by yourself._*
