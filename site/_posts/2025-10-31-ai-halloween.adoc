{nbsp} +

My customers who actually succeeded with AI keep telling me the same thing: +
70% - People & Processes (your domain knowledge); +
20% - Technology (dev work, CI/CD); +
10% - The AI itself. +

BCG just published confirmation. +
Compare -- DX was 40/30/30.

One of my customers put it perfectly: +
"We survived DX using intuition and experience. +
But AI is fickle and temperamental. +
Retrying with the same vendor doesn't work."

He's right.
AI punishes the experience-based biases that got you through DX.
