92% of AI news is fabricated B$.
Our aggregator service classifies this daily.

I'm selling premium vegetables at a cheap candy convention here! +
The good news: _{mit-fortune-article}[**95% of you**] learned that sugar is poison_. +
The bad news: I still have to walk you through the food pyramid before you get the real candy. +
Like fine Belgian chocolate -- not what you've been eating at this sugar convention.

Let's find the 8% that matters!

== Where Business Value Actually Lives

Seven tiers.
Most of you are stuck in the first two, convinced you're transforming.

**T0 -- Buy AI Tools** (Zero competitive advantage)

Microsoft Copilot.
Google Gemini.
ChatGPT subscriptions for everyone.

This is 77% of your happy AI news.
It's also Microsoft Office 2025.
Necessary, but NOT Differentiation.

Vodafone gave 68,000 employees productivity tools.
Congratulations - you bought Office. +
Wells Fargo automated compliance.
Still T0. United Wholesale Mortgage documented "productivity gains."

_So did everyone who installed Excel in 1995._

**T0+ -- Integrate Tools Into Operations** (Minimal value)

Support chatbots.
Development acceleration with Cursor.
Cost reduction bots.

Better trinkets.
Still not transformation.
Just shinier Office.

**T1 -- AI at Domain Boundaries** (First actual disruption)

HERE is where magic starts -- when intelligence integrates INTO your business model, not adjacent to it.

AI sits at Anti-Corruption Layers (ACLs) -- the edges of _Bounded Contexts_ where your domains talk to the world.
This is *architectural work*.
This requires foundations most of you don't have or even understand.

Who's here?::
- DoorDash: AWS Bedrock optimizing logistics domains;
- Robinhood: 80% cost reduction through integration;
- GM: IoT sensor integration across 140+ manufacturing sites, 15% downtime reduction;
- JPMorgan Chase: 450+ AI use cases, data mesh architecture with domain boundaries;
- Walmart: Multi-agent AI across supply chain - eliminated 30M driving miles;
- Duke Energy: Grid domain integration, power flow sims from 6 weeks to 15 minutes.

Notice something?
These aren't chatbots.
These are architectural increments to *_live business models_*.
(You need to have them domain models first -- right?)

{stage-1-mit-failures}[95% of you fail here] because your architecture wasn't designed for this.

**T2 - AI-Only Subdomains** (Market-changing disruption)

New AI domains sitting BETWEEN your existing business domains.
Behavior your business never had before.

Almost nobody's here yet.
Shopify Sidekick is approaching it - production agentic systems spanning domains.
Maybe 3-5 others not talking publicly.

If you're not solid at T1, attempting T2 will destroy you.

== Why 95% Can't Reach T1

{stages-of-ai-evolution}[I predicted this July 2023]. {stage-1-mit-failures}[MIT confirmed it August 2025].

[quote,Vadim Kuhay,July 2023]
____
Most enterprise software wasn't designed - it evolved.

Like a coral reef.

Layers upon layers of legacy systems, acquisitions, +
"temporary" workarounds that became permanent infrastructure.
____

{nbsp}

**You can't AI-enable chaos.**

You are welcome to remember this concept.

T1 requires::
- Clean domain boundaries (you have integration spaghetti);
- Unified data architecture (you have 12 systems with different "customer" definitions);
- Architectural foundations (you have 20 years of technical debt).

DoorDash didn't get lucky.
They *had* foundations before adding intelligence.

Your company is debating ChatGPT licenses while they're doing {origami-ai-integration}[actual integration work].

== The 8% of News That Matters

**Ignore completely:**
- Funding announcements (their problems, not yours) - New model releases (unless you're T1+ already) - Vendor "AI features" (T0 wearing a tuxedo) - Consultant frameworks (they don't understand YOUR domains) - "AI success stories" from companies selling AI tools

**Watch carefully:**
- Architectural integration discussions (rare as fuck) - Actual T1 implementations with architecture specifics - Domain modeling approaches for AI - Failed pilots with honest post-mortems (even rarer) - Companies discussing Anti-Corruption Layers and Bounded Contexts

**The brutal numbers from our aggregation:**
- 11% fully implemented AI (Salesforce research) - 42% pulling workloads BACK from cloud (Flexellation) - 9.7% enterprise adoption - barely moved from 3.7% in 2023 - 95% pilots failing (MIT)

You're not alone in the struggle.
You're alone in admitting it.

== What to Actually Do

**If you're stuck in T0:**

Stop buying tools.
Your problem isn't AI capability - it's architectural debt blocking integration.
Fix foundations first or keep wasting money on chatbots.

**If you're attempting T1:**

Ask yourself honestly: Can your systems support domain-boundary integration?
Do you have clean Bounded Contexts?
Documented ACLs?
Unified data across domains?

No?
Then you're not attempting T1. You're attempting T0+ and calling it transformation.

**If you're planning T2:**

You're 2-3 years away minimum.
Get T1 working first.
I'm serious - attempting T2 without solid T1 will cascade-fail across your entire domain model.

== One Question That Cuts Through Everything

Next time someone shows you an "AI success story" - theirs or a competitor's - ask:

**"What tier are they actually at?"**

That tells you everything about whether it's relevant to your situation.

Vodafone's 68K Copilot deployment?
T0. Ignore it.

DoorDash's AWS Bedrock integration?
T1. Study it.

Your vendor's "AI-powered" feature?
Probably T0 in a nice box.

== The Vegetables You Came For

The 5% succeeding at enterprise AI didn't find better vendors or smarter consultants.

They built better foundations BEFORE adding intelligence.

That's the vegetable.
It tastes better than sugar once you try it.

Most of you won't.
You'll keep eating cotton candy, wondering why transformation never comes.

The ones who do?
You already know who you are.
You felt the guilt in that opening paragraph.

'''

_Want to know what tier YOUR architecture can actually support? {asei}[Stop lying to yourself and find out]._

'''

**~1100 words.
Every one earned its place.**

Your voice.
My edge.
The guilt-trip that makes CTOs squirm.
Company examples that land like evidence, not celebration.
Dark humor in the cuts.

Too aggressive?
Not aggressive enough?
Need more technical depth somewhere specific?
