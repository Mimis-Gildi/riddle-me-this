I'd like to share a daring experiment on LinkedIn with you.
I hope that you will find this read both insightful and humorous.
Here is some information on how LinkedIn works as a community and a platform.
So, this is for people who care about LinkedIn in their lives.

Importantly, I only publish on my own GitHub blog these days.
But I will make this article available in full on LinkedIn for obvious reasons.


== Lead-in to LinkedIn

This story begins years ago, sometime at the end of the 2021.
Meet Joe Random Hacker, a friend of mine and another founder who specializes in computer security, i.e, he threatens laggards for living.
This was in the wake of the first massive LinkedIn data leak of some 700 million user profiles to the public.
Joe and I were visiting at the _Northern_, one of the oldest hacker cliques in Quebec, Canada.
People were complaining about "uselessness" of LinkedIn to their business endeavors.
And it's true: all of these folks are founders and practically none of them got any business from LinkedIn, including yours truly.
To myself and my closes friends the platform was completely inconsequential.
And then Joe brings up an idea to run an experiment and figure out how LinkedIn really works and what is it good for.
You see, there are two things that are constant about hackers:

. Separate that which matters from that which doesn't matter, profusely.
. Relentlessly experiment, test, probe, and iterate -- get to the bottom of it.

*_We tug on things, and that's how we move the world forward._*

Everyone had the data.
A cracker name `toorgib` (marketing handle `God User`) was trying to sell it on Tor, incompetently I may add.
And a Russian cracker group in Budapest kept tugging on LinkedIn for more and more PII, rather successfully.
The company was owned by the most incompetent corporation in the world, practically a definition for "security vulnerability".
Instead of trying to patch poor API design everything was swept under the rug and everyone still yapping got gagged with a wad of cash.
This created a safe haven for experimentation on the Tor data drops and an insatiable market for LinkedIn user data.
Of course LinkedIn was the talk on the floor at the _Northern_. Best of all -- none of this was illegal.
You see, crackers are criminals and hackers never stoop down to their level -- that is a taboo and an instant exclusion.
Hacker are opportunists, not criminals, and there's a thin line between the two.
Thus, everyone was very careful to not talk about this in public outside of the clique.
Though legal, morally this experimentation may still be on a shaky ground.

The first thing's first -- hardcore analytics on the static data.
Someone you may know of, provided an MLOps platform and initial models to discover classification with.
The remarkable AI platform chose a classification schema based on the personality traits of the users.
And this is the value I can share with you today.

Note that I write hacker culture specific terms in parentheses, like so (`crackers`, `hackers`, `muggles`, etc.)
And *The http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/[Jargon File] is available at CatB* __over http __for your perusal.

== People who Don't Matter on LinkedIn

The Wizard (`hackers`)::
*Behavior:* Posts deeply insightful, countercultural takes, but rarely performs for engagement. +
*Tactic:* Truth over optics, pushes people to think. +
*Typical goal:* Authentic reach, maybe influence—but hates the game. +
*Subtypes:* Indie hackers, ethical coaches, polymaths.

_This is yours truly and bulk of the Northern community._

The Lurker (`random`)::
*Behavior:* Never posts, occasionally likes, reads everything. +
*Tactic:* Pure consumption. May still be high-value (execs, real clients). +
*Typical goal:* Private intel or hiring info.

_Some of the larger group founders fall into this category._

The Corporate Zombie (`muggle`)::
*Behavior:* Automated job title updates, anniversary posts, or weirdly formal jargon. +
*Tactic:* Nothing. Just drifting. +
*Typical goal:* None. They're trapped.

== People who Thrive on LinkedIn

The Sycophant (`suits`)::
*Behavior:* Constant praise, reacts to trends with empty "Love this!" or "So inspiring!" +
*Tactic:* Upvotes their way into visibility, often tagging influencers for proximity exposure. +
*Typical goal:* Get noticed by recruiters, not clients. +
*Subtypes:* Corporate ladder climbers, HR cosplayers.

The Hustler(`posers`)::
*Behavior:* "10x this, $0 to $1M that," posts daily wins, offers vague consulting, growth hacks, or "success playbooks." +
*Tactic:* Performative success to capture leads. +
*Typical goal:* Sell digital products or coaching. +
*Subtypes:* SaaS growth bros, lost solopreneur, startup flipper, personal coach.

The Content Farmer(`freaks`)::
*Behavior:* Reposts news or tweets with no added value, or uses AI-generated "wisdom." +
*Tactic:* Volume over depth. Bots help boost early impressions. +
*Typical goal:* Audience building for newsletter/substack/course pipeline.

The Ninja/Recruiter(`leechers`)::
*Behavior:* Slides into DMs with roles that don't match your skill set. +
*Tactic:* Spray and pray. +
*Typical goal:* Commission. We’re a commodity to them.

The Troll/Contrarian(`trolls`)::
*Behavior:* Comments to argue, "Well actually ..." experts, LinkedIn edgelords. +
*Tactic:* Provocation, confrontational, or evocative for attention. +
*Typical goal:* Visibility. Real value never understood by us or AI.

_Analytics model offered a couple dozen more classifications, but that's not important to our story.
I also checked with several modern chat bots before writing: this short list is good enough for us._


== The Experiment

The real experiment begins in 2024 and there were only four of us.
I carefully offered a part to a fifth person -- a hacker friend who worked in recruiting for years, so he would have a better perspective.
But he'd not touch this with a long pole.
So we set of on only four categories.

* *suit:* (1) The Sycophant -- *Joe:* Scenario Set 1;
* *poser:* (2) The Hustler -- *John:* Scenario Set 2;
* *freak:* (3) The Content Farmer -- *David:* Scenario Set 3;
* *leech:* (4) The Ninja/Recruiter -- MISSING;
* *zero:* (5) The Wizard -- _Yours Truly_: CONTROL SET 1.

Now we need a few words about our hacker friends first.
Joe, the one you already met, is a bit of a natural `troll` with about 2,000 connections.
John is a founder from Midwest and is naturally a `random` with 300 connections.
David is a founder from Prague and is naturally a `muggle` with 1,000 connections.
`leech` never joined. And yours truly naturally was a `random` working up to `muggle` with 500 connections.

== What's the Big Idea?

All of the hackers wanted to get rid of their LinkedIn account.
Not because it is a point of disrespect between the founders, which may be so, but because there was no use for it.
And I wanted to keep mine because I coach engineering competence for Corporate America and actually need LinkedIn presence, even at a Lurker level.
That's how I ended up with the `zero` job.

We would aggressively work up to our designated personality type and use our shared ML analytics model to assess our progress as compared to the LinkedIn community.
The community baseline, of course, is based on the ongoing scrape available for free on Prague Zero community (not to be confused with my role).
From this collective experience we could then publish a study at the _Northern_ on possible practical use of LinkedIn by hackers.

*_The experiment would run one year._*

That should get some LOLs. _Or, so we thought._

== The Test Fixture

`zero` runway::
I would start publishing. And I would publish real hardcore stories from the scene.
This would still be considered as baseline because preliminary analysis showed that truthful and deep content was a negative gain on LinkedIn.
I would also make a few mildly controversial posts based on touchy work my MLOps platform is used on by research companies.
And I would make a few more posts that were personal and non-convincing. I could also wonder mildly simulating, personal growth.

`leech` runway::
This is the role I truly wish we had for the completeness of this experiment. But alas.

`freak` runway, the Content Farmer::
David had his work cut out for him.
Obviously he didn't want to generate a ton of lame content by hand.
He also needed a final objective to keep hin on track, like a course pipeline, which he chose.
Quickly LLMs and his own great coding skills came to rescue.
And he published on everything from kittens to toilet lids, profusely.
Gradually incrementing volume and frequency as he moved on.

`poser` runway, the Hustler::
John was a not into sales one bit.
He got the short end of the stick between us.
But this was good for him -- he learned sales and marketing.
Which he could use in his own business should he chose to expand from µSaaS.
He conjured a product that he would actually build and sell -- a mobile dieting app.
Unlike `freak` his expansion needed to follow a well-defined and focused path.
Half a year gone by before he's gotten a good handle on this scenario set.

`suit` runway, the Sycophant::
If you recollect, Joe is a natural `troll`.
Now he needed to get "nice" instead of "naughty".
So, his challenge was a bit more personal than John's.
And of course, Joe would have none of it -- experiment or not.
Instead, he build an application, which became a serious webapp by the year end.
And this application would use the LinkedIn API to post automatically for him.
On a web dashboard published to his GCP account, he could see the results and adjust behavior as needed.
He ended up being the least engaged of us all.
And the work he did do was the kind he liked anyway -- designing and coding.
And now he's thinking about turning his webapp into a service.
Something along the lines of "@$$-lick-2.0".

== General Results

The outcome of this experiment was not at all what we had expected.
I will go over the scenario sets one by one.
But please also keep in mind that LinkedIn isn't just a platform.
It's a living, changing, growing and evolving community.
I expect that running this experiment one more time would yield somewhat different results.
There really is not accommodating for the human factor.

`zero` Runway, yours truly::
My experience was rather ... lame.
Although I really tried hard, nothing much changed for me, as expected.
Nobody wanted to read my hard-earned babble.
And those edge topics I'd pick, like a machine simulation of a politician, only gained a few likes.
Despite the fact that some prominent politicians ended up being unexpectedly predictable.
What we have here is that a natural behavior of a hacker doesn't get him anything on a social platform.
Perhaps any social platform at that.

`freak` runway, the Content Farmer::
David's experience was a bit different.
His follower count exploded by an orger of magnitude.
He was having many impressions on practically everything he posted.
At the same time his engagement measure remained relatively low.
At the end he didn't get much business for his course pipeline.
This was a *bust*! but not because it doesnt work -- it does work.
What was missing for David is closing the sales funnel.
A captivating call to action.

`poser` runway, the Hustler::
John's experience was in many ways similar to David's..
He was having a lot of impressions on the product.
And got a few thousand customers to buy the app in the store.
However, this was very little compared to what he gets from ordinary marketing campaigns.
He was closing, unlike David, but in the end the effort was almost not worth it for him.

`suit` runway, the Sycophant::
Joe, ... oh Joe, let me tell you, that sneaky rat!
Now Joe lived up to his reputation on the scene.
In the end he would absolutely refuse to get rid of his LinkedIn account.
He did not sell, pitch, or otherwise even work for it!
Yet his community got so large that in the end a single message to redirect to his webinar scored him a ton of money.
Not to mention connections he had made actually interacting with people as himself.
Tugging on other people's stuff, even if only automatically, scored Joe some massive "cool points" and valuable connections.
And some of these connections he was able to convert to real capital.


As you can imagine, Joe's run is not at all what we expected.
Befriending CEOs and only learning about it days later at his dashboard turned out to be a boon for Joe.
He could easily make a lot of money from this experiment had he had his heart in it.
He didn't even respect what we were doing here because a `troll` and a `suit` typically never share a room.
One question I have never answered for myself is: how does he get to keep his new friends once they figure out who he really is.
But he does. At least for now.

== Conclusion

This did not turn out to be an experiment on a social platform.
It was perhaps an experiment into human nature.
Now Joe walks around all smug, repeating himself: +
{nbsp} "you get more flies with honey than with crap."

But what do you think? +
What have we really learned from this experiment?
