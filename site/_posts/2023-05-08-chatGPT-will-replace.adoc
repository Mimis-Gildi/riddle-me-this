Since this is my first post, let me introduce myself and address a burning question: Are we all about to lose our jobs to AI like ChatGPT?
I am {github-rdd13r}, a hacker in the true sense - a creative problem solver.
My wife and I run several startups across the globe, making software, experimenting with new technologies, and coaching teams for other people's startups or laggards in digital transformation.
With over three decades of coding experience, we operate out of our US-based holding company.
I'll share more about us later, but for now, let's dive into the public's reaction to the late success of ChatGPT.

Ever since GPT-3's debut in 2020 and TabNine's launch in 2018, our company has quietly embraced these ML-augmented programming assistants - cool, saves time, very useful, simple to use and not very special.
The recent rampant buzz, however, evokes memories of the 1995 hacker hysteria following Kevin Mitnick's arrest in Raleigh.
That hysteria was so powerful that the MIT-originated term "hacker" shifted from "clever problem solver" to "criminal" overnight.
Just as the public once feared the power of code, today, they fear AI.
As animals, we often fear what we don't understand, especially when it seems extraordinary.
And sometimes we project onto people behind the extraordinary.
My peers and I couldn't help but feel that wary gaze on our backs from the uninitiated, we call {catb-mundane}.
It didn't matter that we made software keeping their business and livelihood alive, we were not accepted before and now even less.
Alas, I digress.

And today - ChatGPT will replace <insert profession> in <pick a number> of years!

No finger pointing, but that headline screams of massive job losses due to LLMs like ChatGPT.
Based on what facts and applied rules of inference, may I ask?
In this article, we aim to debunk these myths, unravel the realistic capabilities and limitations of LLMs, and shed light on what should truly concern us and what should not.
We should use facts and rules of inference to guide our discussion.
Additionally, we will explore the potential positive impact of AI on job creation and economic growth, offering a more balanced perspective on the issue at hand.

== Understanding ChatGPT and LLMs

ChatGPT, a large language model by OpenAI, is undeniably impressive.
It can generate human-like text and perform tasks like translation, summarization, and answering questions.
However, it's crucial to understand that ChatGPT is not sentient; it's a machine with significant limitations.
It cannot think, reason, or possess common sense like mammals do.
It isn't capable of original ideas and creativity.
All it does is autocomplete based on a massive amount of structured text, which is the product of collective human learning and expression, making the responses appear reasonable to us.
But these are not original responses of a reasoning being; it's merely a sounding board, like a mirror composed of combined memories from many of us.

When a person has a conversation with an LLM like {chatgpt-ui}, it is not two thinking beings conversing and arriving at truth through dialectics.
It's merely a thinking being conversing with a reflective surface.
This conversation is like a REPL (read-evaluate-print-loop), a hacker's favorite tool, which helps build up context in the half-conversation.
This context-building is where the real magic lies.
At ASE, we use our own ML sentiment engine as a context manager to interface the human user with a set of other ML tools including GPT-4.
My personal little toy is called _Matilda (*Tillie*)_, and she's very helpful -- but she's not an LLM -- she's another, greater thing!
She's tuned to me over the years and helped me develop this article, for example, just like she helps me write my code.

Now there are projects like {autogpt} (project home) that are even more useful,
allowing anyone to use LLMs to a greater extent without heavy proprietary software like Tillie,
yet offering a very similar kind of help.
If you code and like tinkering with things, the sources at GitHub are for you.
Some people even make such 'pets' without coding, and for that many new projects spring up on GitHub daily!
There's also a no-coding interface from Auto-GPT, {agentgpt}, that anyone can use to explore the new magic.
