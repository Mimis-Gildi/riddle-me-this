== 2025: Which Am I – The Oracle, or the Hag?

The failures, the pains, the phases, and the outcomes are spot on.
That's not really surprising – calculated from decades of transformation experiences, applied analytics to well-known corporate culture.
Hardly a prediction. More like reading the writing on the wall with glasses on.

But the parts I got wrong? Now THESE tell an interesting story.

=== Much Slower Pace of Adoption

I was sure that by the end of 2025, Corporate America would be solidly in Phase II.
Your bank website would recognize you. Your insurance would cater exclusively to YOU. Your grocery store would anticipate your needs.

Yet nothing like that exists today.

Instead, we have a CTO avalanche – fired executives everywhere!
Because statistically speaking, Corporate America that HAS succeeded implementing Phase I is a _rounding error_.

This means I was wrong about how many companies actually managed their domains through Digital Transformation.
I hoped for at least 1/3.
Reality? 1/10 or 1/20 at best.
The rest swept it all under the rug and bought tools to hide the mess.

I expected some vendors would be clueless, would try to wing it on hype, and sell CTOs snake oil.
But really?! ALL of them?! That just blows my mind.

_Dilettantes!_ What did you do to my 'Merica while I was out building smart weapon systems abroad?
Ugh, can't leave you alone for a minute.

=== Much Greater Rift Between Innovators and Laggards

We recently helped a medium-sized foreign heavy machinery manufacturer restructure their Root Domain for AI-Native Augmentation.
This company is attempting Phase III!
Meanwhile, American core businesses can't figure out Phase I.

Not the sector I expected to advance.
Not the country I expected to lead.
But here we are.

=== MCP – The Plot Twist I Didn't See Coming

The emergence of Model Control Protocol (MCP) is an incredible blessing I never anticipated!
It makes implementing Phase I a walk in the park.

Of course, to extend the Bounded Context meaningfully, you must first HAVE boundaries to augment.
That's the architectural gap causing 95% of our economy to fire CTOs like confetti.

I've built advanced AI research platforms for the top ten.
Passed around entire symbol DAGs.
Reinvented integrations over and over.
Top universities standardized on our MLOps platform contract.

But the community took a completely different route – implement the simplest possible contract for context.
Address the root problem directly.
No pollution with adjacent complexity.

_Bravo!_

=== The Scorecard

I'll start publishing Phase I failure statistics by year's end.
The numbers will shock you.

Come watch the carnage unfold:

The Oracle sees the future.
The Hag just counts the bodies.
Turns out, I'm both.

_Toodles!_
