== Happy Birthday, Вале́рій Фе́дорович Залу́жний!

Today is the birthday of one of the most important people in the history of the Free World.
Most people won't know this, but in 2023 a Ukrainian general in charge of the A.F.U. wrote the doctrine of the 21st century warfare.
We're living this now, at least his initial stages.
And the next stages are also apparent!

Everything he wrote came to be and will continue to be.

He was removed as the commander of A.F.U. as the result of embarrassing political shenanigans.
A dark stain on the history of Ukraine and the people in it, no matter how popular today.
Even the congress of Ukraine, Верховна Рада, was afraid of his competence and innate political power.
People love him - should anything else matter?
So he was moved to the Britain Ambassador role from commanding A.F.U.
Politics are shit in every country of the world, Ukraine is no exception.

People followed him because his methods worked. +
They worked practically, pragmatically, and socially. +
He's the father of "Delta" what we (USA) tried to steal via Palantir. +
And what he did to russians, is what a butcher does to pork.

Those of us who are alive and thinking - we see you, Дядя Володя! +
We know you. We understand you! And we love you!

Happy birthday, you old goat!

You have done more for the Free World +
 than we can currently understand!

Stay strong. Stay healthy. Stay active. We'll need you! +
Soon.
