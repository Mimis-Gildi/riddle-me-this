Common sense says big companies will dominate the market with AI.
Because big companies have resources.
And small companies are nimble instead.

Paradoxically, company size predicts whether AI will be tried, but it inversely predicts success.

.AI Integration Reality by Company Size

{nbsp}

== SMALL COMPANIES: The Talent Barrier:

More than half of small companies never make it past "should we do AI?"

- 52% cite lack of expertise/skills as their biggest challenge;
- 39% report zero in-house AI expertise.

The ones that DO try AI:

- 91% immediately increase revenue -- direct business value;
- 86% incrementally improve profit margins over short time.

And the kicker is the adoption time -- 3-4 months, instead of 12-18 months industry average.

__Small companies' advantage is more modern and pragmatic tech stacks: 75%+ are building AI-native architectures from the start --
no 1985 mainframes to integrate with (see Y Combinator data 2024, 2025.)__

== MEDIUM COMPANIES: The Danger Zone for AI!

Medium companies show the highest enthusiasm with the worst outcomes.
This is why we at ASE Inc focus our marketing on this segment.
These people have the most to gain yet flop the hardest.

- 91% adoption rate - highest of all company sizes;
- But only 53% feel "somewhat prepared" for AI adoption;
- 39% cite lack of in-house expertise as top barrier;
- 86% need tech stack upgrades - expensive without enterprise budgets;
- *11% publicly claim success, yet only 3% demonstrate actual business outcomes.*

(RSM 2025 survey of 966 middle market leaders comes closest to my research.)

Exploring the root causes, we find these premises:

- 92% encountered challenges during implementation (higher than small or much higher than large companies);
- 70% need outside assistance to maximize AI value despite having more resources than small businesses;
- Only 20% achieved full integration into core operations, while achieving 26% integration is the baseline threshold for generating tangible value.

__My research evidence says: midsized companies are uniquely positioned to lose.
They're stuck between small business agility and enterprise resources.
Not small enough to use simple tools and nimble, competent teams.
Not big enough to drown their problems in money.
__

== LARGE ENTERPRISES: Where AI Gets Expensive and Slow:

Large enterprises can afford anything. They still fail.
And they succeed mostly through brute force.

- 42-60% adoption rate (varies by study - IBM shows 42% for 1,000+ employees, rising to 60% for 10,000+ employees);
- AI budgets: $50M–$250M -- a bit absurd for the results they're getting -- wasting 90%+ of the investment;
- Companies with 250+ employees increase AI usage by 0.11 percentage points every two weeks (fastest adoption rate);
- Large enterprises (1,000+ employees): 42% actively deployed AI vs significantly lower rates for smaller firms.

The important information here is about the kind of stuff that goes wrong:

- 74% fail to generate tangible value (BCG survey of 1,000 CxOs);
- 95% of GenAI pilots fail to deliver measurable P&L impact (MIT 2025 NANDA study tracking 300 deployments)
- 9+ months for AI deployment vs 90 days for mid-market, 3-4 months for small businesses;
- 60% of projects overrun budgets by at least 85%.

The reason for this is what we wrote 2 years ago.
Recent BCG research with 1,000 executives confirmed our conclusions.
This is how we formulated the 70-20-10 rule to combat the core problem:

- 70% of AI challenges = people and process issues;
- 20% = core technology and integration problems;
- 10% = AI algorithms themselves, models, and ops.

Because:

- 75% of legacy systems cannot effectively integrate with AI tools (SnapLogic 2024);
- 81% of IT leaders report data silos hinder digital transformation.

== THE TRUTH:

Yet all of these publications miss what I see as the most important metrics.

Large enterprises spend 80% of their budget on the 10% that fails -- AI theater: models, pilots, workshops, and change programs.
And maybe 20% on the 90% that works -- boring business plumbing that actually makes pay off: Integration and Architecture.
And that produces the 5% of successful projects while the rest just fails.
_Enterprise did not complete *Digital Transformation*._
*Large companies should restart DX and Hacker Culture adoption.*

Medium companies are natural losers, not through any fault of their own but because of unfair market position.
*Medium companies should contract Hacker Shops to upshore Domain Architecture.*

Small companies have the greatest chance at success.
And cower the most.
Small companies should take more open-minded chances.
Because the resource barrier in small companies is easier to fix than the organizational barrier in large companies.

Most importantly, if you're in that stuck middle -- the backbone of American family business
-- talk to your local hacker shop before you sign another seven-figure 'transformation' contract.
We build the boring plumbing that actually works.
Come to us, and you'll have production AI making money.
Not pilots.
Not theater.
Simply working systems.
