= Friday: Fear. Monday: Agents.

link:/riddle-me-this/adventures/2025/09/18/hole-getting-deeper.html[Most IT teams will be deprecated in 2 years.]
Will you be deprecated? Unemployed?
If your employment depends on how others accept tech -- you need to know this.

Four days ago I presented agentic AI to a room full of Corporate American developers.
What I got back was morbid fear -- people stopped asking questions and started airing grievances.

This morning? The same team demoed adversarial agent teams collaborating and competing -- from their own workstations.

Same people. Four days.

== What Changed

Not the tool. Not the policy. *Me.*

Agentic AI -- the real kind, like https://code.claude.ai/docs/en/quickstart[Claude Code] or https://opencode.ai/[OpenCode] -- brings something we've never had before: tooling that teaches the user.

You don't learn it, then use it. You use it, and it teaches you as you go.

All this team needed:

* A real agentic system (they picked Claude Code)
* A curated roadmap -- three weeks to mastery, self-paced, with their agents and teammates
* Someone in the room who earns their respect -- and teaches them to earn their own

Without the roadmap, they'd still adopt. The roadmap just compresses the timeline -- from three months of fumbling to three weeks of directed progress.

Without me in the room? They'd still be scared.

== Why Your Horse Won't Drink

You've been dunking that horse in water, haven't you?

I know you have -- that's 90% of my customers. https://www.youtube.com/live/j-2sQfftqdE[JetBrains confirmed it]: only senior developers adopt on their own. Everyone else ignores it. You make it a policy. Designs don't change. Code stays crap. Velocity drops.

What gives?

It's not about AI. It's about people. Contact with a tool or a policy doesn't change people.
Human-to-human contact does. The right kind.

*To follow you -- they need to respect you.*

*To beat you -- they need to respect themselves.* +
And that's the part nobody told you.

This team transformed in four days because I was in the room.
A real hacker, like them. Doing some cool hacking with them.
Not just because the tool was magic -- because someone showed up who could earn their respect and teach them to earn their own.

That's what I do.
