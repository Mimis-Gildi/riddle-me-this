= Your AI Hail-Mary in a Weekend

Are you afraid to be left behind?
Attending too many "important" meetings instead of practicing your craft?
Stuck supporting the same boring Spring-Boot-v.Ancient artifacts at work?

This weekend I presented autonomous competing agent teams to a room full of Corporate American developers.
What I got was not a constructive follow-up dialog -- like I get with most startup communities.
Instead? Fear. Real morbid fear. The kind where people stop asking questions and start airing grievances.

If that's you -- *chilax* -- _I've got you right here_.

*_The same thing threatening you will save you!_*
Agentic AI is your way out.
And it only takes a weekend. Not a year.

== Our Mental Traps

I see someone I'd once done solution architecture with post: "I will start on Python to learn AI..."

He "fell off his horse" and lost his skills, obviously.
And now he feels dread because he thinks he knows what's coming.
He doesn't.

*Here's that trap:* _take classes online, learn Python, learn fundamentals of ANNs, then learn about LLMs, then finally research practical applications._
A year into that study-path you will have definitively realized that you have done absolutely nothing for your career yet.

Meanwhile, the tools kept evolving. And, more importantly, easing!

Don't do that 1980s thang!

== What Change Mattered

Quick history -- because it matters to you:

- *2023:* Language models appeared in IDEs as passive chatbots. You had to drive every interaction. Limited. This passive structure required the user to drive the narrative -- making for a lame assistant that resisted you and hallucinated constantly.
- *2023-2024:* Cursor and Windsurf integrated AI with your editor's Language Server Protocol. Better. Cursor 1.0 was a meaningful step forward. You may remember me posting heatmaps how much Windsurf autocompleted for me -- no longer relevant. At all!
- *Mid-2025:* Finally, Anthropic, my darlings, had some sense to apply one ancient technique -- the REPL (read-evaluate-print-loop) boosted with actor-model roles and flows. Obvious in hindsight -- every hacker's favorite toy -- instant gratification.

And that *_changed EVERYTHING_*.

== The Magic YOU Need

Fortunately, the same magic that deprecated one laggard is exactly what can save another.

https://code.claude.ai/docs/en/quickstart[Claude Code] -- takes 5 minutes to set up -- not just for code. Backed by full-featured Anthropic models and robust human-to-human-like working models, this collaborator will do any job with you and teach you in the process.

I personally have made software with it, of course. But also published content, designed businesses, trained teams, and learned a bunch of new disciplines by-doing. It's not limiting -- I operate agent teams via MCP-A2A bridge. The only constraint is that your root agent is Anthropic.

Once you get dangerous, explore:

* https://opencode.ai/[OpenCode] -- my daily driver. Fully open, run your own infrastructure, or use their https://opencode.ai/zen[Zen catalog] for hosted models. This was the demo that frightened the room -- competing virtual teams.
* https://replit.com[Replit] and https://aider.chat/[Aider] -- solid alternatives with different strengths. Not my cup of tea, though.
* https://antigravity.google/download[Antigravity] -- if you're a Google shop, this brings agentic development to your whole team.

== Your "Come to Jesus" Weekend

Here's what I do with teams in my weekend seminars. Works for developers and beginners alike.

*If you're a developer:* Go to https://code.claude.ai/docs/en/quickstart[Claude Code quickstart], set it up (5 minutes), and tell it:

Claude, I am outdated. Dude, I have not followed -- what can you do to upskill me NOW?

That's it! That's your first project. Let it assess where you are and teach you BY-DOING.

*If you've never coded -- don't worry:* lots of folks vibe-coded entire companies this way.
Download https://cursor.com/download[Cursor 2.0], open it, and ask a similar question.
It will meet you where you are.
Cursor 2.0 with Composer is agentic, beginner-friendly, and will teach you *_any_* craft -- not just programming.
Like I said, "whole companies."

== Go, go, go!

You can let that thang that disrupted you teach you your way out!

Now *_that's_* fun. You'll see!
