= Your AI Hail-Mary in a Weekend

Are you afraid to be left behind?
Attending too many important meetings instead of practicing your craft?
Stuck supporting the same boring Spring-Boot-vAncient artifacts at work?

This weekend I presented autonomous competing agent teams to a room full of Corporate American developers.
What I got was not a constructive followup dialog, like I get with most startup communities.
Instead, I got remorseful crippling-fear airing of grievances.

If you work in such an environment -- DON'T WORRY!
I'll give you your lifeline the way you can use today.
And it doesn't matter if you developed before or not.

First, we need to break bias and assumptions that are stopping you cold when you should be having fun moving.
I see someone I'd once done solution architecture with post "I will start on Python to learn AI..."
He "fell off his horse" and lost his skills, obviously.
And now he feels dread because he thinks he knows what's coming.
He doesn't!

Fortunately, magic that deprecated one laggard is exactly what can save another!

First, we need to get a COMPLETE developer's understanding of the ancient Transformers and modern Agentic AI in 5-sentences or less.
In 2023 there were some language models behind a chatbot in your IDE, and these apps are completely passive
-- don't waste your time. This passive structure required the user to drive the narrative making for a lame passive-resistant liar of an assistant.
Then Cursor in 2023 and WindSurf in 2024 integrated IDE assistants with Language Server Protocol (LSP) alongside a Transformer
-- that gets us AI coding assistants -- better, but don't waste your time; although Cursor 1.0 was marginally revolutionary.
And finally, mid 2025 we had some sense to apply another ancient technique;
the REPL (read-evaluate-print-loop) boasted with some actor model type roles and flows
-- and that CHANGES EVERYTHING.

https://code.claude.ai/docs/en/quickstart[Claude Code] -- takes 5 minutes to set up -- not just for code, backed by full-featured Anthropic models and robust human-to-human-like working models
this collaborator will do any job with you and teach you it in the process. I personally have made software with it, of course,
but also published content, designed businesses, trained teams, and learned a bunch of new disciplines by-doing.
It's not limiting -- I operate agents teams via MCP-A2A bridge, the only limitation is that your root agent is Anthropic.

Once you get dangerous, you can try https://opencode.ai/[OpenCode], my tool of choice -- a completely open platform you can run your own farms with,
hosted offerings through their https://opencode.ai/zen[Zen catalog], or any combination of. Alternatively, https://replit.com[Replit] and https://aider.chat/[Aider] can do the same for you.
And if you are a Google shop, then https://antigravity.google/download[Antigravity] will do this to your whole team.

Look, you can do what that aforementioned solution architect planned: take classes online, learn Python, learn fundamentals of ANNs, then learn about LLMs,
and finally research practical application options.
A year into such a study-path you will have definitively realized that you have done absolutely nothing for your career yet!
Bummer, isn't it?

Or, you can let the thing that disrupted you teach you your way out -- now that is truly fun!

== Your Weekend

*If you're a developer:* Go to https://code.claude.ai/docs/en/quickstart[Claude Code quickstart], set it up (5 minutes), and tell it:

I am outdated, I have not followed, what can you do for me to upskill me hands on?

That's it. That's your first project. Let it assess you and teach you by doing.

*If you've never coded:* Download https://cursor.com/download[Cursor 2.0], open it, and ask the same question. It will meet you where you are.

BTW, if you have really never coded, then the latest incarnation of https://cursor.com/download[Cursor], the 2.0 with Composer,
is agentic, beginner-friendly, and will teach you any craft, not just programming, as well as the other agents I'd previously mentioned.

You are welcome!
