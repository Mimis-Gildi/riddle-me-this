= CTOs Deploying AI Fastest All Answer One Question the Same Way!

Everyone's hunting AI use cases.
Winners are refusing them!

Dozen customers -- One pattern.

The CTOs who deploy in weeks have a *"Kill List"* before they have a pilot.
The stuck ones seem to say "yes" to everything and tend to finish nothing.

*My question:*

_"What AI use case are you saying NO to -- and why?"_

*The fast deployers said NO to:*

- AI that touches 3+ systems before proving value in 1 (ONE);
- Use cases where the training data classes don't exist in the wild;
- "Transformational" pilots with no owner to get fired on "fail."

No owner, no hard calls.
Eighteen months later, you're still "learning." And "transformational" is a fallacy of its own type of misery.
Best successes I experienced are "augmentational" in existing business context.

Strategic NO is your MOAT! +
_Competitors copy your use case in a quarter._ +
*_They can't copy your discipline._*

What I repeatedly see: Same AI initiative; Same vendor; Same tech.
One ships, another doesn't.
What gives?!

*Clarity about what NOT to do.*

Because who cares about pilots.
What's in production!

That answer starts with what you refused.

What's on your "NO" list?
