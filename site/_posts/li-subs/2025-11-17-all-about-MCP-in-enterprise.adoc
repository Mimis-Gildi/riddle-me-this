= Stop Creating "MCP Teams"

Prospects keep asking us to help them form and train MCP teams.

Don't!

MCP is a protocol.
Like REST.
Did you hire a separate REST team when HTTP became standard?
(Some did and are too embarrassed to admit it now.)

Did your home builder hire a separate nailgun team when power tools showed up at Lowe's?

Just train your domain teams on MCP fundamentals.
One weekend bootcamp.
Done!

Extending systems with ML outside of business domain context makes no sense.
Your domain teams already understand the business logic -- they just need the protocol knowledge to augment with AI.

Build competence into your existing teams.
We can help you with that -- make communities of practice
-- deliver valuable working software with experts you already have.

Stop chasing senseless fads.
