= AI Adoption -- Best time is now!

Break into lucrative AI -- no time like right now!
There is no going back.
The AI bubble will burst.
But Generative is here to stay.
And it's a requirement not option.

After years building and fixing technical teams, I can tell you exactly why AI adoption fails:
_wrong people doing the wrong work_.

- Most "AI coaches" don't code.
- Most teams get paralyzed by consultant theater.
- And executives replace teams instead of enabling them.

I just wrote *the straight path* for _both *companies* and **individual engineers**_
-- the 80/20 split that actually works, the technical competence that's actually needed, and why Google's developer ecosystem currently offers the lowest friction (though I'd not trust them long-term).

Full disclosure included.

If your team is stuck in AI adoption paralysis or your engineers need actual technical guidance -- let's talk.
I build competence, not dependency.
