= US Geopolitical Power Drops by HALF with Latest Peace Plan -- But HOW Do _THEY_ All Know?

Thousands of OSINT analysts worldwide reached the same conclusion about Trump's 28-point Ukraine plan within hours of the leak.

Not speculation.
Not opinion.
Documented, repeatable, peer-reviewed analysis.

OSINT analytical consensus has proven remarkably reliable when process is documented and peer-reviewed.
And they have been wrong before: Iraq WMDs, early COVID analysis, etc.
Yet it is precisely this open process that assures any gaps are closed for good.
And their promise: "collecting and analyzing publicly available data to *produce actionable insights*." And today this is *_the_* body of insight.

*How?!* _Just how?_

Infrastructure nobody talks about!

Years ago, our community leased AIOps framework ASE maintained for decades to analytics firms across Denmark, Sweden, Poland, Ukraine, and US through American colleges.
One condition: everything produced is open intelligence.
No royalties.
No credit required.
And NO hidden data or functions.

That infrastructure since grown in leaps and bounds and is now processing geopolitical events in real-time.
The modern tools are five generations down the line and are available freely to ANYONE.
And leave the old methods in the dust.
Know that private advisory firms use these open analytics as basis for billion-dollar recommendations.
In fact, without OSINT there is NO private intelligence!

Most people see the conclusions.
I see the plumbing -- the MLOps, the data pipelines, the analytical frameworks that make certainty possible.

Your enterprise is trying to do the same thing -- whether you know it or not.
Produce reliable intelligence from data.
Make decisions with confidence.

I wrote about this years ago as https://mimis-gildi.github.io/riddle-me-this/adventures/2023/07/05/integrated-ai-evolution.html#phase-iii-ai-propagation["Phase III: AI-Propagation"]
-- business intelligence as repeatable infrastructure.

So, what is the difference between your "AI project" and strategic "Intelligence Capability"?

The same infrastructure gap that separates Twitter speculation from OSINT consensus.

Before you buy another AI tool, ask:

- Can we document our process? (_behavior_)
- Can others verify our conclusions? (_premises_)
- Can we repeat this analysis reliably? (_declarative_)

That's what thousands of intelligence organizations solved. +
That's what your AI initiative needs.

*And there is no excuse:* *_today all the tools you need are freely available with GCP, AWS, and competitors._*

There is only one gap: ARCHITECTURAL COMPETENCE.

_Ping us to see how you get yours closed._
