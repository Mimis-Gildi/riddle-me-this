Anton (16, ASE Inc intern) just published his first company analysis.

He spent a few days analyzing AI adoption data across company sizes -- combining our founder community research with public studies.

The finding that surprised even me: company size predicts whether you'll TRY AI, and inversely on SUCCESS.

The gap between theater and reality is brutal, especially for midsize companies:

- 11% of companies publicly claim AI success;
- Only 3% demonstrate *_actual_* business outcomes.

_Medium companies claim 91% adoption but harbor the worst results._

His full analysis explains why - and what to do about it.
