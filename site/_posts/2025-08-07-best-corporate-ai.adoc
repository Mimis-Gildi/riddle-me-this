Let me share a revealing AI success story!
We can see what helps corporate successfully integrate AI.
What kind of decisions, and what kind of corporate culture drives such repid adoption?
And what happens to the business Architecture in the process.

AI-Native doesn't need to be hard.
But it has a few prerequisites.
It needs a little grassroots competence.
And some basic Systems Architecture.

*_This explains how to slam-dunk AI integration on your own!_*

This article also explains a very advanced use for AI in 2025
-- the type of AI that makes a hard market divide between profit and loss.

A CTO Bible on Fource Phases of Corporate AI Adoption is a very useful read for your context: +
*_{cto-bible}_*.

_**TL;DR for you** -- companies that *CAN* just integrate AI now:_

. Clean Architectural Boundaries are present;
. Bounded Context Taxonomy is democratized{footer-cto-trap}.


== About The Customer: The Origami Corporation.

{asei} has privacy and confidentiality in its root policy.
Though, I have customer's permission to share and bare it all
-- the business is proud of their achievements
-- I will stick to the bare minimum necessary to tell their story in a way that matters to you.
But don't worry, I can make a CTO-CTO confidential introductions, just DM me.
Also, this company publishes a lot and can easily be found by searching the web.

Now the important part -- about this fine company.

This business is a small manufacturer of power hydraulics for heavy machinery worldwide.
"Small" is relative to their industry, not their finances.
And they only have maybe ~200 engineers of all kinds on payroll and another ~100 small contractors.
Less than ~30 software engineers work on company's business domains -- this is an important detail!
Overall, they're a part of one of the largest heavy machinery conglomerates globally, yet operate largely autonomously.
And they do plenty of their own R&D work as well as custom and external manufacturing.
We'll call them Origami Corporation.

I hope a business picture is emerging for you.
This is more difficult to operate that say an insurance business is, for example.


=== The Business Problem: Flow is Everything.

Origami's kit is in everything from German/Swedish/Ukrainian tanks to heavy mining machinery and TBMs to most sophisticated aircraft and ships.
Imagine the logistics involved int that!
Most importantly, Origami is conformant to their national industrial ways.
Unlike American and European manufacturers where human workers pull the brunt of assembly tasks, Origami's assembly lines are nearly fully automated.
And that creates some unique and difficult challenges -- control over production pace is life or death for high pass-through business like them.

Despite production automation business operations are a whole other world of their own -- and we step in here.
Manufacturing engineers automated supply chain, but not supply chain management -- that's a different domain.
After the large American software company made a big mess, it was {asei}, our company, that in six weeks of 2017 mapped Origami's path do domain mastery.
I was focusing on the US market at the time and offered them an ecosystem of small capable startups to draw on -- which they did.
If I had known then what I know now -- I would have just continued partnership with Origami indefinitely.
But alas, the company attained their desired domain state in 2019.

*Let's focus on the most important historic outcomes first:*

. 2016: Origami buys business software solutions from an American conglomerate, EvilCorp.
. 2018: Origami fires big software in favor of OpenStack, OSS, and own small teams.
. 2019: Origami completes it's business remodelling <- we will start our story here.
. 2024-03 to 2024-07: Origami fully accomplishes AI phase 1: liabilities -17%. <- very important.
. 2024-06 to 2025-02: Origami fully accomplishes AI phase 2: liabilities -19%.
. 2024-12 to 2025-06: Origami fully accomplishes AI phase 3: liability -23%, revenue +3%.
. 2025-03 to Present: OMG, Origami is attempting something akin to AI phase 4! +
But HOW?! +
Let's see?!

The picture that should be emerging in an American CTO mind here is *_the deliberate and managed business domain mastery_*.
We will focus on the architecture with this in mind.


== How did Big American Software (EvilCorp) FAIL Origami?

And how will they fail you on your own AI Integration Journey?!
I think these are important points to understand.
In the simplest sense -- there was a conflict of interests.
Origami wanted to rein in complexities of their business operation due to globalization.
And the big American EvilCorp wanted to sell software for every little business problem.
This only works in commodity market.

*_This is exactly how companies are failing AI Integration today!_*

But let's just dive deeper.
What prompted this manufacturer to look for startup wizard-coders worldwide in the first place?
When I first had my 1-hour meeting with this company's CTO, it went on longer than four hours.
Normally, I'd terminate it.
But he was so passionate.
He was telling me how EvilCorp was destroying his entire business.
After they replaced their working bespoke software with bloated and overcomplicated CrapWare Platforms of their own, that the users didn't know and didn't like, they went after the holy grail -- the production stack.
You see, such manufacturing units must ALWAYS be isolated from the internet!
Yet there arise the need for constant information flow from the production to the business domains.
And EvilCorp pushed for integrating production with the business domains.
Some really absurd crap, if you ask me!
But they were after the databases.
You see, EvilCorp sell manufacturing databases, and Origami ran production on Oracle RAC which works better for them.
That was the last straw for this CTO, who went against CEO to meet with founders.


== How I made the Unlikely Sale to Origami.

I started our 1-hour meeting with the same basic philosophy I function on:

. _**KISS** (Keep It Simple Stupid)_;
. _Know thy **Customer**_!
. Break *NOTHING*;
. _Only then, *fix* something_.

That KISS principle really resonated well with this CTO.
In fact, I think that my Japanese friends hold this principle in high regard.
He loved the idea of architectural freedom, simplicity, and decoupling from external dependencies.
In fact, he was already on his way to OSS mentality -- maybe that's why he sought my kind out.
Once he understood exactly how I solve problems, he made up his mind long before I knew it.
The bottom line:

*Just be honest!*


== The 2019 Pre-AI Integration Story: Important Fundamentals:

In 2016 Origami was buying a platform upon a platform from Americans EvilCorp, but that only made things worse.
Having switched to competent advice and own teams' maturity development, the company executes extensive restructure.
Once cleaned up this is what their architecture looked like:

.Cascaded Modular Monolith:
image:{img-prefix}/origami-2019-modular-monolith.png[]

Let's understand this architecture and how is it different from the American Software Conglomerate EvilCorp architecture.
_Why was this company was able to implement stage after stage of AI Integration *without any preparation*?_


=== Origami's Modular Monolith -- NOT Cloud-native Distributed System:

A keen observer may right away say that this is not a typical distributed system as happens in digital transformation.
Who made it? Should you not have recommended cloud components? How is this transformed?

I'm glad you asked! I designed this in 2018, right after my massive Deutsche Bank dbECM Platform released, which is fully distributed to the last lambda,
but then this solution is something vastly different from dbECM! -- what gives, `rdd13r`?
Have you ever heard the expression: "When all you know is a hammer, than everything looks like a nail?"
A competent system designer will know and be able to personally implement ALL modern concepts and patterns,
instead of pedalling the same narrow and lame buzzwordy tech. Real solving goes something like this:

. FULLY understand the business domain; the problem space; the business context;
. Thoroughly evaluate ALL business assets, their capabilities and cost of replacement;
. Solve for durable, reliable, time-tested, and cost-effective architecture -- three times;
. Offer customer all best options in order of cardinality.

This customer made some sound decisions: coach engineering team to ownership, retain Oracle RAC, go with open source and architecture as much as possible.
And we ended up with a Distributed (after all) Modular Monolith: Four well-defined Enterprise Archetypes (templates).

EvilCorp architecture was one big "pseudo-distributed mess" tightly packed with their proprietary software.
Instead, wASE Inc offered the smallest possible effective solution.

And that's what happened here -- let's see more.


=== Archetype: Production Assembly Line:

Take a look in the bottom left corner of the diagram. The segregation there is "Production (Assembly 1-N) INACCESSIBLE."
Note that production lines were already in process of being integrated into "pseudo-distributed mess,"
so we rolled them back to the "production assembly line" the way it was designed by a brilliant Japanese vendor in 2012.
And added one very special component that fit on a small rack on the back wall of the factory: "Revolving Gateway Client."

So, what is this "Revolving Gateway"? More appropriately, the "Revolving-Door Security Gateway" pattern.
Not very popular in typical corporate environments, but the world's most complete catalogues of patterns from the USA Department of Navy has a whole chapter dedicated to it
-- it's more common in weapon systems. The customer chose this architecture pattern because it is the strongest know form of security protection against exploits from the outside AND inside.
The way it works is simple: the system is disconnected from the internet. Imagine a round room at a cross of two hallways (X) with a door that can be opened against only one of the four hallways at a time,
by rotating the room. Let's say that we want to traffic people by the North-South hallway while East-West hallway is for the cops.
At a precessed time using rotated certificates The gateway positions in the North position -- the internet and accept a long encrypted ledger payload for an internal recipient in the South position.
The external party think that it completed a transaction with the intended recipient, but it's just captured -- the person walked in and the room rotates into the East position (clockwise).
Here the cops will inspect the person and change them into an appropriate working attire. The ledger is being validated and reprocessed against another set of rules and certificates.
And then the room rotates into the South position -- this time the gateway simulates the sender. And so it goes with the response.
I have greatly simplified the way it works for the sake of simplicity. In reality nothing can call in -- all operations happen by a call-out instead.

This is NOT a singleton -- every separate factory is set up like this. And Origami has a few of them too.

This solution had only one drawback the initialization needs to be done by the sneakernet. Which Origami didn't mind.

Later in the article we will come back to see how this construct actually hides an ACL (Anti-Corruption Layer) necessary for seamless and fully decoupled AI integration.


=== Archetype: Business Domain (Operation N)

Let's move North-East on the diagram and take a look at the "Business Domain (Operation 1-N)" archetype.
This is your ordinary corporate business domain. There is only one on the diagram but just like the previous archetype this is not a singleton.
Every "business department" is set up like this and there a few in their office building.
Each one is a namespace and has its own necessary compute, storage, services and databases.
It operates exactly like any modern corporate IT environment with two additional important differences.

. Added Revolving Door Security Gateways in case this part of business has anything to say to manufacturing;
. In enforces a concept of Corporate Taxonomy (CTX) from which Enterprise Dictionary is automatically generated.;

It also accomplishes one additional point: A) Leaves Origami's bespoke application be; B) While providing a way to migrate to CTX over time.


=== Archetype: Officers' Pods (Revolving Door Security Gateway)

This is a very small Archetype that lives in the Public Cloud, and it is a Singleton, the first one we encounter.
Various Business Domains and the Root domain we'll mention later come here from time to time to get the next time gap certificates,
without which production assembly lines come to graceful shutdown. It also controls the revolving door rotation period.
Remember, this CTO was worried about another Asian country getting into his business and stealing the manufacturing secrets.
He knew busting through the buggy EvilCorp bloatware would have been a child's play for this aggressive actor.
So he has a place where with his secure-key he can pull the plug on all or some parts of his business to prevent any further damage.
The Colonial Pipeline fiasco did not happen yet. But if you research that incident today you will see that Colonial too had some poor-man's segregation protocols in place
-- and those saved the pumping operations from damage crackers wanted to bring.

This Aggregate does not need to know about the Corporate Taxonomy and the nature of business operations.
It does however publish the global "Trunking Policy" -- how all the "Change the Business" software releases function
-- same function as Google's Borg "root manifesto" for their Trunking Policy.
For most companies this did not need to be separated out of the Root Domain -- even Google does not extract is out.
But this has gone a long way to give this vendor-gouged CTO some solace and a peace of mind:

In 2019 the Revolver period was 1 hour and the ETL exchanges would take about 3-5 minutes to process the data and shut down rotation.
Then the CTO would test his rolling blackouts every quarter.
Today, after the extensive AI integration is accomplished, I hear the period is 4 hours and the ETL takes about an hour.
While the rolling blackouts are tested annually. I think this speaks for trust in technology.


=== Archetype: Root Domain (Eventstream Gateway) (Chinese Walls)

And Finally, the Root Domain, a Singleton where the business definition lives.
This where the VCS and TrunkOps live as well. Most developers and hardware engineers sit here too.
Origami lakes it this was and there was no reason to change it.
Also, the Master Ingress Controller is here -- meaning all the internet traffic must check in here.

At the end of this article you will find an Appendix which elaborates on the makeup of each domain a little more.

But what you should already get a sense for is clear separation of concerns (job descriptions) for each Archetype mapping to a domain.

I hope that you are also  getting a sense for a massive reuse effort while modeling the future-proof architecture of this company.
The sacred law of "Knowing Your Customer" goes a long way in healthy business interaction. Take local data centers for example.
The American software conglomerate was pushing hard on the "Cloud First" model -- which is all they knew
-- mainly their of cloud, but if not, others would do. But that doesn't just disregard the customer -- it also dismisses and insults them.
Origami had a lot of small data center experience, and their need to run own hardware is not going anywhere soon
-- in fact, most manufacturing companies need to manage a lot of own iron anyway. Origami has had a competent Systems IT department,
people who know how to buy good hardware cheaper and put it together efficiently.
Moving all that iron into a cloud, or even a part of it produces no benefit and only introduces 3 major problems:

. Dependency on someone else's SLA policies, hardware and software choices;
. Triple or quadruple run the business costs because cloud provider needs profit too;
. And finally, a big one, no control over exploitability of someone else's assets and liabilities.

One other aspect of this design Origami absolutely loved -- it can all be done in parallel, by many small hacker teams taking on one concern at a time.
And these teams would at all times be integrated with the business people whose domain they're standardizing.
Most importantly, there were no superficial deadlines on the whole program -- teams can work when they can, taking into account "Running the Business" needs.
Sure there was a bottleneck of myself and ASE Inc. to produce, socialize, and publish the final business-technology architecture draft.
But that is only 6 weeks of time, which is not much compared to 2 years of inaccessible EvilCorp perpetual bottleneck.


=== Why does this architecture work so well for AI Integration?
