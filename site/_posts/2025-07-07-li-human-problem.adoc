Hope everyone is rested well after the long weekend.

Here I am going to address the real problem I've discovered with the LinkedIn experiment.
And it's not even about linked in itself.
It's about humans.
In this instance -- myself!


== Recap: Professional Social Networking

In the three parts prior this article I'd explained our year-long experiment and how machine analytics classified LinkedIn personalities.
The we attempted to analyze why the sycophant personality was accumulating connections at a much greater rate than the rest of the community.
And finally we took a long hard look at the LinkedIn as the platform itself.

But here is the kicker -- all of our analysis equally hold true for any such platform.
It just happens to be that LinkedIn has no competition in its space.
But every social network for what ever its purpose follow the same pattern and the same fate.
We could have intuitively deduced so based on the way  Cory Doctorow defined his unpleasant term.
This would cover the social aspect and the business aspect.
Here I want to take a close look at the human aspect.

The important point to understand here is that there are MANY uses for LinkedIn.
It truly is a rich and even feature bloated platform.
Let' just recollect personalities that analytics discovered in the first part.
And then these personalities span over industries, cultures and even countries.

Here, I will just be examining my personal case, which I think are most ordinary users -- The Muggle.
Any by The Muggle I mean all three types of the ordinary user:

The Corporate Zombie (`muggle`)::
*Behavior:* Automated job title updates, anniversary posts, or weirdly formal jargon. +
*Tactic:* Nothing. Just drifting. +
*Typical goal:* None. They're trapped.

The Lurker (`random`)::
*Behavior:* Never posts, occasionally likes, reads everything. +
*Tactic:* Pure consumption. May still be high-value (execs, real clients). +
*Typical goal:* Private intel or hiring info.

The Wizard (`hackers`)::
*Behavior:* Posts deeply insightful, countercultural takes, but rarely performs for engagement. +
*Tactic:* Truth over optics, pushes people to think. +
*Typical goal:* Authentic reach, maybe influence -- but hates the game. +
*Subtypes:* Indie hackers, ethical coaches, polymaths.

_Which is myself, for example, at different stages of LinkedIn proficiency._

== The Human Problem

The previous experimentation was done on a very large data set.
Especially the general user classification and Joe's experience.
Yet it's impossible to tell on a live system which part is mostly algorith and which is simply human nature - i.e, us.
So, I decided to look at myself and my own data set.

I've complete the experiment with almost 2,000 first degree connections.
And I didn't start with much less than that, so I've gained very little over the year.
Thus my analysis was geared towards what what I have from LinkedIn that is great.
What I wish I had from LinkedIn that I don't have.
And is that the limitation of LinkedIn as a platform, or any social network for that matter.
Or something else entirely?

And what I came up with surprised me.

The top three features of LinkedIn for me are are::
1. Connections Data -- the rolodex as Michael pointed out.
2. Messaging System -- which is essentially business interaction.
3. Connection Graph -- which is no longer available.

And my top peeves are as follows::
1. Strong bias for new interaction over existing connections maintenance.
2. Bloated news feed and DM queues.
3. Maintenance time for usability and ergonomics.


What my peeves basically boil down to is that I need to interact with the system a lot to influence what I want to see versus what I do see.
This includes clunky multistep controls to tell it "less like this" and then offer a mandatory reason.
Always pressed for time I want to get valuable interaction quickly.
So, what would be valuable interaction for me?

*_I want updates on people I care about. My older connections. People I personally know._*

But what I get is an endless feed of what i didn't expect.

== Solving the Human Problem

One good way to understand a problem is to attempt to solve it. And that's what I did wit a help of a friend.
I have exported my data. Created a Jupyter Notebook to analyze it.
And disconnected from everyone I hadn't personally interacted with.

I've started with the connections export. I've sliced through it using Pandas and DataSpell.
And I didn't see much of a bigger picture.

The I proceeded to the messages export. I've sliced through it using Pandas and DataSpell.
And I found a lot of interesting stuff.

* 91% of the bloat was from recruiters.
* 6% of the bloat was from sales people.
* Only 3% of the messages were from people I interacted with.

More interestingly, almost half of the recruiter bloat was just from 9% of the recruiters in my 1st degree connections. And the total count of the recruiters was 331.

This data analysis also showed WHEN these recruiters were added to my connections.
And that they were added just over a period of two years when I hired personal aid to help me manage my communications.

Having removed all the people that I actually didn't have a relationship with finally made my feed useful again.
And that happened practically instantaneous.

== The Really, Really Big Problem

Now I've come back to the connections dataframe. At first I moved in reverse chronological order and didn't find much that I missed.
The I sorted in chronological order. First connections I made were in 2007.
And I was stunned. I realized that I hadn't kept up with the people most dear to me.

Oh, that really blew my fuses. Immediately I made another Python Class to manage my connections and messages in the same dataframe.
And I diligently went one by one through all of my connections from the beginning.
More disturbing observations followed:

. I know many people. Really many people. After cleanup about 700 connections remaining.
. I am a very bad person. I hadn't talked to some of my best friends for years.
. About 1/4 of my conversations I left hanging - never responding to a friend.

Oh, Lord, what have I done?!

As any hacker would I immediately started blaming everything but myself -- LinkedIn, of course.
And called a friends to solve this problem of keeping up once and for all!

And we did. We quickly came up with an algorithmic model to do the keeping up for `rdd13r`.
And then we start on impact analysis....

My friend said: "I absolutely hate it! This is the most dehumanizing thing I've ever conjured."

So, what is the problem here?
And the problem is this -- everything we farm out to a system we lose ability to to ourselves.
The most fundamental feature of a human being is to stay in touch with those who are dear to us.
I didn't do that! And now, I was designing a system that does it for me.

And right here we arrived at a pretty grim realization. We have a human problem. not a system problem.

== Summary: Who's to blame?

This is no problem of LinkedIn. LinkedIn is a business, they have a moral obligation to stay as profitable as possible.
In the beginning it was just us, ordinary users, and the system catered to us.
Then LinkedIn gained other profitable users, such as recruiters and sales people.
And the system catered to them too, spreading the wealth of value and stratifying the revenue.
It does what it's supposed to do. And enshittification is just a phenomenon of times in capitalism.

At no time LinkedIn removed out ability to stay in touch with those who are dear to us.
It was all on us.

As my friend I talked we got grimmer and grimmer::
- "When was the last time you talked to Aaron?"
- "I dunno, a year ago." "And you?"
- "About the same." "And David?"
- "Gosh, I don't remember." "Longer."

An interesting phenomenon emerges here. We're not good at keeping up with people.
Especially where there are more than a few friends to remember.

== Conclusion

All the systems around us, even if it's just the one, provide us with basic tools that we use for our human needs.
But it's up to us to mind those needs. For the most fundamental there can be no automation.
It's easy to blame software. But in this case - I'm just a poor friend.
And LinkedIn is not a culprit here.

The correct way to use a tool like LinkedIn is this::

. Decide what you want LinkedIn to help you with, i.e., rolodex, direct messaging, and so on.
. Learn the capabilities and quirks of the tool. And check for any other tools available.
. Use the tool to its practical potential and remember, it's just a tool -- outcome is on us.
