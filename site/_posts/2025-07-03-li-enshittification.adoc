Happy Independence Day, Friends!

Before I close the door on LinkedIn,
I need to thank a couple of my friends for their patience, wisdom, and support.
Genuinely stuck trying to name good things in LinkedIn, I used "call a friend" lifeline.

{li-aaron}{gh-aaronfllr}::

Aaron is a full-spectrum hacker.
Others will spend weeks planning and arguing.
Aaron quietly whips out his Jupyter Notebook -- in any IDE.
And has the answer in a day or two, while others still argue "worth it or not."
Yet Aaron’s best magic comes from the fact that he’s never sidetracked by the noise of the world.
And here was a bit of noise to deal with.
I owe Aaron the big-picture view and the value mapping analysis.

{li-michael}::

Michael is a people hacker -- a human capital specialist across both recruiting and business development.
On LinkedIn, he’s probably user 7 -- the one who got many of us on.
He used the platform from its earliest days:
connecting people, referring people, brokering business development, hiring talent,
and routing contacts through funnels and networks based on trust.
I owe Michael the full value history of LinkedIn -- from zero to now.

== the TL;DR

The Australian {mcd}{mcd-wiki-fn} named *_"enshittification"_*{estf-doflo-fn}{estf-reddit-fn}{estf-wiki-fn}{estf-podcast-fn}{estf-gr-novel-fn} +
its *2024 Word of the Year*. The term describes the

 gradual deterioration of a service or product brought about by
 a reduction in the quality of service provided —
 especially of an online platform —
 and as a consequence of profit-seeking.

It was selected by both the dictionary committee and the public vote.

"Enshittification" was coined by Cory Doctorow to describe how tech platforms evolve and <decay> as they begin prioritizing profit over user experience.

The process typically involves an *initial phase of* +
_offering good service to attract users_, +
followed by a *decline in quality* as the platform seeks to +
*_maximize profits for shareholders_*.

=== not <decay>

Yet there is an important misleading point about decay in the formal description above by Cory.
Consider once legendary insurance company in 1922, formed by a dynamic husband-wife duo.
This company cut through market like Skjold-class corvette through Kattegat -- with authority.
Major investor acquisition later gives it nine lives and today it floats like FUBAR-class log in a canal.

Ladies and gentlemen -- this is what we must understand about the former, the enshittification.
While the latter, the insurance company, is the product of time digesting and passing pusillanimous laziness and complacency -- a natural process of decay.
The former, enshittification, is not decay: it's a _choreographed, planned, and controlled process_ -- intentional.

_By <decay> Cory meant the user perspective alone._

== the _"Original Good"_

Back to LinkedIn (LI).
When the platforms first started it had some of the most amazing features.
A groundbreaking value proposition both in the social and the business sense.
LinkedIn was disruptive simultaneously in several domains. +
Did you know that LinkedIn once had a *Connection Map feature?*

LinkedIn entered with a bang of value::

* 2006: Public Profiles, Recommendations, *People You May Know* -- not like today, especially the last one;
* 2007 LinkedIn Answers -- a clear community building direction;
* 2008: Mobile Version, Applications Platform -- a clean nod to the OSS community.

2011–2014: Going Public and Feature Refinement::

* 2013: Discontinues LinkedIn Answers, modifies 2005 feature "Groups;
* *_2014: Retires InMaps -- a network visualization tool;_*

_Still very much user-focused and community-driven mindset at this point._

*_2016: Microsoft announces acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion._*  +
{nbsp} -- have you ever heard of that king where everything he touches turns to ... I forget what.

== the _Hard Turn Port_

* 2017: New desktop interface, aligning with mobile, oddities not asked for by users.
* 2019: Launches "Open for Business," enabling freelancers to showcase services.
* 2020-2022: Content Creation: Events, "Creator Mode", analytics for newsletters and posts -- new rating models.
* 2024–2025: AI Integration and Feature Saturation, quickly versioned rating and popularity models.

== the _"Tor Bazaar" and _"Deep Waters"_

In a way, it is unfair to call out acquisition as the culprit as users were bullied in preparation for acquisition as well.
Let's just look at user community most criticized change:

* 2013: Retirement of LinkedIn Answers, removing a Q&A feature most valued by users.
* 2014: Discontinuation of InMaps, eliminating a tool for visualizing professional networks.
* 2017: Removal of contact tagging and filtering features, further reducing user control.
* 2021: Termination of LinkedIn Stories, a short-lived feature aimed at sharing brief updates.

But the whole story again is better told by the scene of the hacker collective.
You see, there's is constant tug of war between *_hackers_* and *_crackers_*.
Crackers are opportunistic criminal finding vulnerabilities and stealing data for sale.
Hacker fix vulnerabilities closing the door for another to be opened by crackers.
These two groups of people despise each other, watch each other, and are connected at the hip.
Watching the dynamic of both tells you the story marketing is trying to hide.

In the Tor community bazaars where data leaks are bought and sold by crackers, there's a deep, dark, and slow water.
It's an undercurrent of both hackers and cracker watching the field for different information.
And it's constant.
Crackers look for things to steal and sell, each other, and hunt for hackers.
And hackers look for trouble signs in corporate culture and criminal trends.
So let's go through the most important events in the life of LinkedIn.

== 2011 -- long Road to ... Kakistocracy

In 2012 a devastating data breech leaking 6 million user passwords slams LinkedIn like a train.
Oh, but this began long before 2011. By 2010, this was a fine company running thick on hacker power.
Testament to that are the early technologies coming from the shop to the scene.
Everyone has heard about Kafka by now.
Even one such magic is enough to pinnacle a team to the top of the scene.
But the list was massive: Azkaban, Rest.LI, Pegasus, Helix, Samza, Gobblin
-- and these are just the ones wildly popular today.
The actual scene demos were in dozens. Shy hackers show and tell incredible tech in bars with a chalk board.
Even until this day LI is still rolling out the tech from those early days.
My favorite was LiX (LinkedIn Experimentation) -- A/B testing framework and everchanging toolbag.
I'm crazy about testing and have tugged on everything under the sun, but even I was moved by LiX.
Yet all this magic also paints a big fat cracker bullseye on company's back.

What I just shared so far is only possible py perfect Community of Practice and a large synergetic hacker collective.
Which means these people were really close to each other.
So, when in preparation for monetization and investment a lot of new,
less competent people joined the company to "set the direction to profit."
As you can imagine, hackers didn't like all the marginalization and replacement by cogs and muggle.
The first drops to Tor were from the new team.
And these were painful and cultural in nature.
By 2012 LI was fast on the way replacing thinkers with obedience.
Entire teams resigned.
And this left holes.
Infrastructure components with entire teams of IQ too low to understand what's in production.

Interestingly enough, none of this bothered the upper management. "Money solves all problems" was the mindset.
If you read the story of Kafka, a personal drama and a story of grief and distention, here, I told you a secret --
that's where it is coming from. But LI pressed on. Against the brains that built the company.
The 2012 was simply inevitable.

Now, if one would that that it raised alarm bell, one would be wrong.
Microsoft infusion or money and culture greatly accelerated the process.
Because Microsoft is the very definition of "vulnerability."

* 2017: 117 million credentials, and a discovery that leaking had never stopped.
* 2018: First "bad API" Scraping incident. Technically legal. Nevertheless incompetence born.
* 2021: 700 million users profile data on sale, actively updated. M$ reporting fixed 😁
* 2024: Scraping and spoofing Arms Race: publicly discovered the leaking never stopped.

Perhaps this help to understand Joe's position on LI data in the first story.
He runs a security company. Hackers never respected incompetence.
By his moral codex -- LinkedIn is an open database.
Because if LI wanted that stopped, they would have done something about it.
Joe might as well believe that leaking is LinkedIn's business model.

Contrary to popular hacker beliefs, Microsoft didn't break LinkedIn.
They just brought the culture and the means of sweeping stuff under the rug.
Hey, but everyone loves a good villain.
And EvilCorp is always the best one.

So, now you have the backstory.

== the "Reality on the Ground"

The important question is what's in it for us, the mere mortals?
Let us then start with the basic facts.

LinkedIn is wildly profitable, the Loss Leader Model, currently::
. Premium Subscriptions (Gasoline): profitable with margin, expensing ALL infrastructure.
. Marketing Solutions (Staples): $7B per year, in the current cycle.
. Talent Solutions (The Candy): Microsoft will never tell you this.

What does this mean? LinkedIn runs on loss leader model, like your neighborhood gas station.
They will sell gasoline ever at aloos, and bolt on all expenses to it.
The te staples, like milk and egs will have a small margin.
But the candy and the cookies will be the cash cow.
In the LinkedIn world, even the gasoline makes profit having paid for all the infrastructure.
Just think about it. No matter what they do to you and I their net margins go up.

We can immediately conclude that we have here::
. A monopoly on professional identity market;
. And, a hated incumbent.

Looks to be a very opportune situation for a hacker collective.
However, mind you:

We also have::
. A user and business data hoarder;
. Pay-to-Play casino boss;
. Bait-and-Switch gamer.
. A Surveillance Paragon;
. Business Development Operating System;
. And a revenue Trojan Horse.

Sure, a few hackers can launch a Minimum Lovable Product in under a year.
All the love the LinkedIn once promised to be.
And that would get up to a hundreds million dollars per year in a heartbeat.
And here, a whole different game would begin, the kind these hackers haven't seen before.
From here a slow and hard rise to the top can change your company too.

It's worth to remember this::
* It doesn't matter how good your software service is.
* It only matters how good you *business model* is.

Certainly, given room the same hackers can make the LinkedIn just a good as well.
But there is absolutely no interest in doing so.
Case and point -- do you use Windows? I don't. So what?


== the "Good in LinkedIn"

I was going to celebrate finding my long lost friend on LinkedIn as my only positive.
She's an incredible person and a great hacker I haven't talked to or coded with for two decades.
And I pinned her on LinkedIn -- she's responded.
I was so happy that I went and told my whole family about it.

*But I didn't find her on LinkedIn!* LinkedIn did nothing for me here.
I found her in my LinkedIn data export that I analyze with my DataSpell IDE and Pandas.
She had few connections and no activity. No profile picture.
And in my natural interaction with the UX -- it would never show her to me.
I'd need to filter my connections list manually, pushing buttons.
Well, I can do that much better in Jupyter Notebook.

This isn't it. But there are a few cool use cases yet.

ToDo: Michael explained that LI is a perfect rolodex for him.

ToDo: Ask Saga what else is good here.

And there is yet one more wildly useful feature: LinkedIn is EASILY Gamed.
Remember what Joe did in the first story?
He played a Sycophant model. And he automated it.
Not only it was easy but it also was wildly successful.
Perhaps the best feature of LinkedIn for a hacker is *exploitability.*
And that is the only solid options I see here.
*_Game the game!_*

== Conclusions

LinkedIn is not a villain on the block.
It's a properly opportunistic business, just like every healthy business should be.
It functions by exploiting the psychological and social vulnerability of the *_American Employee Culture._*
And somehow that exploit fits well in many other countries on the planet.
Founders and all kinds of hackers are excluded from this market.
That's why more than 90% of my hacker friends don't have a LinkedIn account.
(Except for Joe, he now has a large one.)

There is a very large untapped opportunity here.
I've been running analytics since the experiment.
And I estimate that a wide-open market is worth about 13% of LinkedIn at a MINIMUM.
The are founding hackers and competence shops, people who will never use LinkedIn.
At the moment they have nothing of value available to them.

Here, it's worth to remember how sales actually work in nature::
. There are people who will NEVER buy from you.
. There are people who will buy with your effort.
. And there are people who will ALWAYS buy from you.

The last group is known as a "Natural Customer".
Every startup I help hackers raise, dozens till date, I always harp this point down hard.
There is a hard and an easy ways to do things.
Knowledge, learning, thinking, testing -- make easy.

. Always target you Natural Customer first.
. Revenue early, as early as possible -- before product, if you can.
. Expand outreach on your Natural Customer first, before marketing stratified.
. Always seek out other hackers.

In this case, other hackers are the natural customer.
Let me know if you want to launch.
Maybe I will join you.

Happy long weekend!
