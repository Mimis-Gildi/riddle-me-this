Happy Independence Day, Friends!

Before I conclude on LinkedIn, I want to thank a couple of my good friends for their patience, wisdom, and support.
I was genuinely stuck trying to name good things in LinkedIn, and shortly we will understand why.
And I had a hard time focusing on my mind map.
But then:

{li-aaron}{gh-aaronfllr}::

Aaron is a full-spectrum hacker.
When others spend weeks planning and arguing,
Aaron quietly whips out his Jupyter Notebook, practically in any IDE, and will have the answer in a day or two.
Once thing I always respected about Aaron is that he doesn't get sidetracked by the noise of the world.
I owe Aaron the big picture view and the value mapping analysis.

{li-michael}::

Michael is a people hacker: a human capital specialist on both the employer recruiting and business development arena.
On LinkedIn, he's likely a user 7 (seven), the one who got many of us on.
He actively used the platform from its infancy days:
connecting people, referring people, brokering business development discussions for companies, hiring people,
and driving people to different funnels and networks based on relationships.
I owe Michael the full value history of LinkedIn, from no to now.

== TL;DR

The Australian {mcd}{mcd-wiki-fn} named *_"enshittification"_*{estf-doflo-fn}{estf-reddit-fn} as its *"2024 Word of the Year".*
The term describes the _"gradual deterioration of a service or product brought about by a reduction in the quality of service provided,
especially of an online platform, and as a consequence of profit-seeking"_.
It was selected by both the dictionary committee and the public vote.
"Enshittification" was coined by Cory Doctorow to describe the way tech platforms evolve and deteriorate as they prioritize profit over user experience.

The process typically involves an *initial phase of* +
_offering good service to attract users_, +
followed by a *decline in quality* as the platform seeks to +
*_maximize profits for shareholders_*.

== the _"Original Good"_

When the platforms first started it has some of the most amazing features for the users providing value both in the social and the business sense.
Did you know that LinkedIn once had a *Connection Map feature?* Wouldn't you love to have that ability today?
Technically we, through an exploit, but more on that later.
