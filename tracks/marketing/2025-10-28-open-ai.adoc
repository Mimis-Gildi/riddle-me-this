OpenAI is NOT your Future.
It's not even theirs.
Ouroboros.

Thanks Patrick Boyle for finally saying it.

Your business needs something different.
Something DoorDash, Robinhood, GM, Walmart, Duke Energy already have.

Domain Boundary Augmentation - treating AI as architectural component, not salvation fantasy.
Your business getting smarter IN business, not cheap trinkets bolted ON business.

Right now?
Google has both:
- Training resources engineers can actually learn - Enterprise tooling teams can actually use

AWS close behind.
Don't bet on M$ though.

When you understand this - we show you the way.
