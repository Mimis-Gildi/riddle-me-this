FINALLY - An honest take. Still.
Ryan, "oh sweet child of mine" - it's not deliberate technical debt!
Ryan McBeth nails WHY enterprises can't just "use redundant nodes" when AWS goes down.
The secret: Most companies lifted old apps into cloud. Software is a cost center. Once it works, ship it.
The mistake: Calling this "technical debt" implies someone CHOSE this mess.

The reality:
Nobody chose the coral reef. It evolved.
Then everyone who understood it left.

I must come in.
Fix the nastiest forgotten debt first.
Right the ship.
Stop the listing.
Company's happy.
Crisis averted.

Then they forget the lesson.
Create more debt.
Ship lists again.
Rinse. Repeat.
