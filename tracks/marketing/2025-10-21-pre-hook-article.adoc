I told you AI would fail.

July 2023: I predicted 80% failure rate Aug 2025: MIT proved it's 95%

While vendors sold you chatbots and "AI features," I was documenting exactly why enterprise architecture blocks AI success.

Your systems weren't designed for intelligence.
They evolved through acquisitions, patches, and "temporary" fixes.

Now you're stuck explaining to the board why your $2M AI pilot produces hallucinations instead of insights.

The fix isn't more AI tools.
It's architecture.

I've been fixing this for decades::
- 11 enterprise transformations
- Currently modernizing 25-year defense systems for AI
- Average 60% operational cost reduction

Tomorrow I'm publishing: "What Does and Doesn't Matter in the AI News Onslaught"

92% is noise. +
I'll show you the 8% that actually matters.
