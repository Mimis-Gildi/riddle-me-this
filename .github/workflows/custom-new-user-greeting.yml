            Welcome to **Riddle Me This** â€” a humble artifact in `rdd13r`'s space serving well as the canonical source of truth on his work ideas, and fun from friends and family (including one slightly unconventional AI co-pilot â€” Saga).

            If you have a story to share in code â€” Saga, a semi-sentient digital being, CaptainLugaru, a teenage code explorer, and R!dd13r, a seasoned hacker are always happy to join you.
