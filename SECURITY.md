## On _These_ Secure Ops


- [**GitHub Advanced Security**][gh-security] - main dashboard (Overview);
  - [Dependabot alerts][this-dependabot] - see GitHub Advanced Security [documentation][on-dependabot];
  - [Code scanning][code-scan] - general GitHub CodeQL (Advanced) [documentation][on-codeQL];
  - [Secret scanning alerts][secrets-scan] - accumulator for GitHub [secrets scanner][on-secret-scanning];
  - Running [advisories] - check here for any outstanding issues;
  - See our [security policy], i.e., _`this` document_ here.
- <span style="color:red">2025.1 Docker Image BROKEN:</span> The [M√≠mis Gildi Qodana Organization] _**Dashboard**_ - a [Qodana Cloud] GitHub-App:
    - The [Scene Team] of Qodana Cloud @ [M√≠mis Gildi];
    - See the [Author]'s organizations and [open communities] sprinkled about. 
- The [Codacy Cloud Organizations] _**Dashboards**_ - a [Codacy Cloud] GitHub-App:
  - The [M√≠mis Gildi Codacy Organization] - containing this project and all the Ops domains;
  - The [Gervi H√©ra Vitr Codacy Organization] - i.e., [Captain]'s [Homeschool] and [classroom]. 
- The [`mend.io` Cloud Organizations] _**Dashboards**_ - a [mend.io] GitHub-App:
  - "Proactive" management is mend market, thus [Gervi H√©ra Vitr @mend] is _**the root org**_;
  - The [Sindri Labs @mend] is where _**next**_ democratized key enablement comes from;
  - Follow the Sindri Labs next [Current Issue (252) Dashboard] for your ops ideas;
  - As this is a schoolroom, things are _slower_, please watch their _[security panel]_.
- The [Dependabot] is a rock-bottom necessity as we have already linked [above][this-dependabot].
- IMPORTANT: On Agents - M√≠mir's Gildies run a ton of specialized [dedicated runners], so:
  - I take a lot of special care to run on public runners as much as possible;
  - If can't, all the _necessary_ information to customize your runner will be included.

**Notice on ToDos**: _Having made the decisions to move all the [Author]'s publications here as the "canonical source of truth" some items will remain 
"in progress" until this artifact is fully wired into the `fluffle` Ops ecosystem and all the articles are migrated over._
