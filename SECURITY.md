## On _This Minimalist Automation_

This is just a small blog and r√©sum√© publishing site.  
Ops are intentionally simple, just enough to not repeat myself,
let the box do mundane work:


- [**GitHub Advanced Security**][gh-security] - main dashboard (Overview);
  - [Dependabot alerts][this-dependabot] - see GitHub Advanced Security [documentation][on-dependabot];
  - [Code scanning][code-scan] - general GitHub CodeQL (Advanced) [documentation][on-codeQL];
  - [Secret scanning alerts][secrets-scan] - accumulator for GitHub [secrets scanner][on-secret-scanning];
  - Running [advisories] - check here for any outstanding issues;
  - See our [security policy], i.e., _`this` document_ here.
- The [M√≠mis Gildi Qodana Organization] _**Dashboard**_ - a [Qodana Cloud] GitHub-App:
    - The [Scene Team] of Qodana Cloud @ [M√≠mis Gildi];
    - See the [Author]'s organizations and [open communities] sprinkled about. 
- The [Codacy Cloud Organizations] _**Dashboards**_ - a [Codacy Cloud] GitHub-App:
  - The [M√≠mis Gildi Codacy Organization] - containing this project and all the Ops domains;
  - The [Gervi H√©ra Vitr Codacy Organization] - i.e., [Captain]'s [Homeschool] and [classroom]. 
- The [`mend.io` Cloud Organizations] _**Dashboards**_ - a [mend.io] GitHub-App:
  - "Proactive" management is mend market, thus [Gervi H√©ra Vitr @mend] is _**the root org**_;
  - The [Sindri Labs @mend] is where _**next**_ democratized key enablement comes from;
  - Follow the Sindri Labs next [Current Issue (252) Dashboard] for your ops ideas;
  - As this is a schoolroom, things are _slower_, please watch their _[security panel]_.
- The [Dependabot] is a rock-bottom necessity as we have already linked [above][this-dependabot].
- _**Snyk**_: Once a decent platform: [Mimis-Vardr] project space (see [learn snyk]).
- IMPORTANT: On Agents - M√≠mir's Gildies run a ton of specialized [dedicated runners], so:
  - I take a lot of special care to run on public runners as much as possible;
  - If can't, all the _necessary_ information to customize your runner will be included.

**Notice on ToDos**: _Having made the decisions to move all the [Author]'s publications here as the "canonical source of truth" some items will remain 
"in progress" until this artifact is fully wired into the `fluffle` Ops ecosystem and all the articles are migrated over._

The following diagrams reflect the current **Riddle-Me-This Secure Release Governance ([v3.11.0])** pipeline as of this release. IDE side enablements, i.e., the
fluent workflow, are out of the documentation scope.

## üìä End-to-End Release Flow Model (Simplified)

The diagrams below illustrate the full GitHub Actions release pipeline for this repository, including:

- Automated versioning & publishing flows;
- Conditional builds for individual components (site / resume / demo);
- Security scanners activated at various workflow stages;
- Label-based selective publishing;
- External dependency monitors contributing branches (Renovate / Dependabot).

### üîÅ Publishing Pipeline

The full lifecycle of branch creation, pull request progression, version bump, label detection, conditional publishing, and final GitHub release generation:
